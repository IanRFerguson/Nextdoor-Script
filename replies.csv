"1","Martha Huezo","She answered that in the statement."
"1","Martha Huezo","Most likely they will ignore you. I have called and they don’t respond. I have to take the animal to them."
"1","Ana Castro","It’s so so so wrong to report an animal as aggressive. This could be someone’s pet that just got out of the yard & just because they so happen to be pit bulls it makes it so much worse. If they’re deemed by animal control as aggressive then when the owners pick them up the owners will be  forced to move the dog to a city that will allow “aggressive dogs”. Or even have to give up the dog. This is also why pit bulls are seen as aggressive is when people make up fake lies it doesn’t do any justice to anyone nor the dogs who for all you know, could be very well socialized and sweet, but just lost."
"1","Martha Huezo","Well, lesson learned. She had dog’s and people’s interest at heart. I see what you’re saying Ana, but you never know anything with dogs. 2 pit bulls attacked my dog. The owner claimed they were nice."

"12","Melissa Conley","Amazing!! So happy you could get them!! See you next week!"
"13","Alesone MacCormack","Thank you!!! Elastic 1/4 inch  like the type pictured any colour is needed too as well as thread, 100% cotton (heavy tee shirt type) material is needed. If you have any heavy tee shirts that are 100% cotton with any design I will make your masks from that material for you and use the extra for masks for children. It will be difficult enough to get the little ones to wear them, parents will have an easier time of it if the children think the mask looks “cool” lol"
