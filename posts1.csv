"Alexander Barber","Southeast Hollywood East","Measure S aka the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative","General","2017-01-09T05:51:52","Hey guys so I have a friend who is working on the Yes on S campaign, and we'be been debating it since he got the job, with myself being opposed to it (so far) and he of course advocating in favor of his employer. 

My biggest concerns with it are environmental, as minimum parking allotments for new developments would certainly mean more land paved for parking. 

200 square miles of LA county have already been paved for this reason, not including roadways, instead of being used for badly needed new parks and public green spaces, and that sucks.  Parking scarcity is a pain, but some things are more important than the convenience of motorists.  The Earth, for instance.

Also, I think S would leave many of the high density apartments currently being constructed around transit stations in a state of limbo not unlike that target in hollywood, and these transit oriented developments are crucial to changing the way people exist in LA, starting with kicking car culture to the curb and embracing transit.  

On the pro side, S would make city planning meetings more accessible by requiring they be held in the afternoon so working people can attend with greater ease. 

There is also DEFINITELY some development related corruption going on in city hall that badly needs to be weeded out, for example: http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-seabreeze/

But I'm still not completely convinced that the measure will actually do what S states it intends to.

Even after reading the full text of the proposed law, I'm left with more questions than answers.  

What do you guys think about it?","18"

LA Sanitation is hosting a series of Open Houses at your local district refuse yard on specific Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Come join the dynamic duo “Mr. Recycle” and sidekick “Robo Blue” as they jump into action to serve family fun, food and prizes for kids. Kids can also operate the controls on our trucks!

LA Sanitation’s Lopez Canyon Environmental Education Center will host an activity booth about the city’s green bin recycling program and give away small vegetable plants. Visitors will plant saplings to take home, use mulch and compost made from residential yard trimmings, and learn about “closed loop” recycling. More than 2,200 vegetable plants were potted and given away to residents last year. LA Sanitation will also partner with “City Plants” to provide 50 fruit and 50 shade trees for adoption by city residents, on a first-come-served basis at each yard, while supplies last. (L.A. city residents must present valid identification with their city address or a current DWP bill to adopt a tree. Note: the limit is one tree per property address.) “Used Tires” from city residents will also be collected, which is provided by a grant from CalRecycle. (L.A. city residents must present valid identification and a current DWP bill to drop off used tires. Note: a maximum of nine passenger and/or light truck tires will be accepted, but tires on rims and used tires from businesses will not be accepted.)

        ","statewide plastic bag ban","General","2016-11-21T22:11:41","Hello LA!
This is just a gentle reminder to carry reusable bags to the grocery store as you do your holiday grocery shopping.

On ​November 8​, 2016, California voters approved Proposition 67 to implement a statewide ban on single-use plastic carry-out bags. The ban takes effect immediately across the state in all 482 cities and 58 counties. Customers at grocery stores, retails stores with a pharmacy, convenience stores, food marts, and liquor stores will need to remember to bring their own reusable bags or pay a $0.10 fee per recyclable paper bag or reusable alternative. The statewide law allows city and county governments to continue to operate under their own ordinances if the guidelines were adopted before January 1, 2015. If they were not, communities must comply with the new state law.

The City of Los Angeles adopted its own single-use plastic carry-out bag ban with $0.10 fee per recyclable paper bag in June 2013 effective for large supermarkets in January 2014 and expanded to drug stores, convenience stores, and other types of smaller food markets in July 2014.

Recycling or holiday items
Flattened wrapping paper, cards, and cardboard boxes can all go in the recycling bin.  Bows, ribbons, and tinsel cannot be recycled.

Berendo and surrounding streets are nicknamed ""Lawn Park"" because of the number of cars that park on the greenbelts/grassy sections between sidewalk and street. Given the housing market and density, the odds of a one bedroom apt having only one car are slim, and a two bedroom can have up to four people with cars.

        ","Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over - Report Drunk Drivers - Call 911!!","Crime & Safety","2016-12-21T22:21:50","This holiday season, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will be out looking for drunk & drugged drivers as part of a special year-end Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over enforcement mobilization.

""Beginning December 16, and continuing into the New Year, you will see stepped up enforcement watching closely for anyone who is driving impaired,"" said Lieutenant Ferry, Traffic Coordination Section, Emergency Operations Division. ""We want to keep our roads safe for holiday travelers, so we will have zero tolerance for drunk or drugged driving.""

As part of the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over enforcement campaign period, municipal police departments, county sheriff departments and the California Highway Patrol will be deploying DUI Checkpoints and DUI Saturation Patrols during the upcoming 17-day DUI crackdown throughout the region. Through December 23, 2016, The LAPD has the following DUI-related enforcement activities scheduled:

Thursday, December 22
•DUI Saturation Patrol in Hollywood Area from 5 P.M. to 1 A.M.
•DUI/Driver License Checkpoint at Vermont Avenue and 5th Street from 7 P.M. to 1 A.M.

Friday, December 23
•DUI/Driver License Checkpoint at Imperial Highway and Main Street Avenue from 7 P.M. to 1 A.M.
•DUI/Driver License Checkpoint at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Paxton Street from 8 P.M. to 2 A.M.

Drugs such as prescription medication, marijuana or illicit drugs can impair judgment and get you the same DUI arrest as alcohol. Nationally in 2014, 32,675 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes with 9,967 people killed in crashes involving an impaired driver. In California, total highway deaths were reported at 3,126 with 1,155 lives lost in alcohol and/or drug impaired collisions. If you're caught driving impaired by alcohol or drugs, you could face jail time, fines, loss of driver's license, towing fees, and other DUI expenses, totaling $10,000 on average.

""Driving under the influence is not only costly, but can ruin the holidays for you, your family or for someone else's family,"" said the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) Director Rhonda Craft. ""Make the decision to drive sober or use our DDVIP app to help you find a safe ride home for yourself or your friends if you know they've been drinking.""

Drivers are encouraged to download the Designated Driver VIP, or ""DDVIP,"" free mobile app for Android or iPhone. The DDVIP app helps find nearby bars and restaurants that feature free incentives for the designated sober driver, from free non-alcoholic drinks to free appetizers and more. The feature-packed app even has social media tie-ins and even a tab for the non-DD to call Uber, Lyft or Curb.

For more information on the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over enforcement campaign and all OTS efforts, visit www.ots.ca.gov. To learn more about the DDVIP app, please visit the OTS Facebook at www.facebook.com/CaliforniaOTS or follow OTS on Twitter @OTS_CA.

The LAPD wants everyone to have a safe and memorable holiday season, and is calling on everyone to be alert; 'Report Drunk Drivers - Call 911! Funding for this holiday enforcement campaign is provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.","0"

The Zacuto attaches to the camera via a frame that adheres to the camera. The viewfinder then neatly clicks onto the camera, making it easy to install and remove. It will fit most cameras with 3 inch screens.

Many people shake with apprehension when they consider sticking anything to their camera, but a) the frame is easy to install and b) I removed the frame from my camera by simply sliding dental floss between frame and camera. Not a bit of damage. I think it's a better mounting system than the bulky alternative later created by Zacuto.

The viewfinder provides 2.5x magnification. It's in PERFECT condition and comes with an extra eye cup, strap, new unused adhesive frame and mounting instructions.

A business colleague asked me to help him find an affordable boarding arrangement for his two new cats:  

""I adopted two of my business partners cats. He had to give away all of his cats to prevent the Health Department for causing a problem for him. Two of them - young male cats - were my special friends. So I took them to a good animal hospital and had them neutered and got them their basic shots. I have been boarding them at the hospital since Wednesday night. This is very expensive. I almost had s place to keep them for the rest of this month but that fell through. I need a place for them for the rest of November. I will be moving into my own place in December and will have them live with me. Do know anyone who might keep them cheaply? I will pay something for this and also pay for all supplies. They are totally indoor cats.""

He lives near USC but somewhere nearby would surely be appreciated:

Thank you,

Adrian","2"

        ","FREE recycled water","General","2016-10-11T20:24:31","Through a partnership between LA Sanitation and LADWP, the City of Los Angeles now offers free recycled water to all LADWP/LASAN customers. Our customers can now get disinfected recycled water for approved purposes, free of charge. Just bring your water containers with water-tight lids to the Residential Recycled Water Fill Station (RWFS).

Los Angeles-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant
4600 Colorado Boulevard
Los Angeles, CA 90039
Open every Saturday and Sunday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. (Closed on holidays and rainy days.)

Recycled water helps promote conservation by offsetting demand for precious drinking water. Customers may use recycled water only for landscaping purposes, such as maintaining trees, shrubs, gardens, and lawns.

To be eligible to receive free recycled water at the fill station, customers must complete a brief  training class before filling up. Upon completion, participants can receive up to 300 gallons of disinfected tertiary recycled water per operating day.

In order to qualify for the Residential RWFS, participants must:

x Be an LADWP customer. Customers must bring their LADWP bill and a government issued ID to the Recycled Water Fill Station training for verification.
x Take the Recycled Water Fill Station training provided by the LADWP. Training is free and will be conducted on-site at the fill station.
x Please RSVP by email at recycledwaterinfo@ladwp.com.
x Submit a signed Recycled Water User Application and Agreement Form.
x Place the LADWP-provided “Do Not Drink” purple stickers on ALL containers used for transporting recycled water.
x Bring your own water-tight lid containers to the fill station. All containers will be checked for proper labeling. You must carry and maneuver your containers; LADWP personnel will not help load or carry any containers. 

Recycled Water Containers
Bring your own water-tight lid container(s) to the fill station. Tie-down straps to secure the containers are recommended for your safety.

Participants will be allowed to pick up a maximum of 300 gallons of recycled water, free of charge, per program operating day. Plan accordingly when determining how much water to pick up and keep in mind the size of your vehicle when selecting transport containers. Ensure your vehicle can handle the amount and weight of recycled water you collect and transport. Driving a vehicle with heavy, sloshing liquid decreases vehicle stability and requires longer stopping distance.

The newly launched Clean Streets Challenge (read more: http://bit.ly/CleanStreetsChallenge ) is a program that does just that. Here's a story of the type of people we're looking to empower:

Reeyan Raynes didn't spend this past weekend like the average high school Senior. While most of his peers were likely at the beach or watching football, Reeyan was organizing the Kiwanis Club -- an international volunteer organization -- Girls Scout Troops, and neighbors for a roadside clean-up in his community of West Hills. If that doesn't impress, consider the fact that Reeyan along with the West Hills Neighborhood Council has been doing a monthly clean up for the past two years!

Reeyan's interest in serving his community began in Middle School when he got a behind-the-scenes look at the Los Angeles Fire Department. The visit encouraged him to find ways teenagers could be involved in emergency preparedness. He joined the Public Safety Committee of his local Neighborhood Council where his dedication made him stand out. When a position on the West Hills Board became available, Reeyan was asked to step up as chair of the Community Beautification Committee by another longtime member, Mike Castro. From his new position, he worked with co-chair, Tony Brosamle, and other members of the Board organizing monthly clean-ups that would address overgrown weeds and litter build-up on sidewalks. 

This latest clean-up attracted over 40 volunteers and gathered over 60 bags of overgrown weeds and loose litter. Reeyan is just one example of a community member organizing successful clean-up efforts with Neighborhood Councils happening around the city on a regular basis. 

To encourage these efforts, we've created the Clean Streets L.A. Challenge which rewards Neighborhood Councils, Community Groups for organizing and hosting clean-up efforts across the city. To find out how you can participate visit the Clean Streets L.A. website ( http://bit.ly/CleanStreetsChallenge ) and help make our communities and our city beautiful.","0"

Sometimes for long periods of an hour or two.  He's usually listening to rap on his headphones and often rolling joints. He leaves his trash and empty medical marijuana containers on the steps and I've been noticing small tags on the porch. Tonight I drove up and saw him write the tag pictured on our window. He was about to write another when I approached the door and asked what he was doing and told him to stop writing on our home. He walked away.. But I'm sure he'll be back. I'm super baffled by his bold behavior and a bit intimidated. Does anyone know what that tag means? Also, any advice on how to handle this? Ive contacted police before about this guy and they didn't seem overly concerned. I'm also .. perhaps unfounded.. kind of afraid of retaliation. Ughhh. Help!","13"

"Alexander Barber","Southeast Hollywood East","Revised Trash and Parking Petition [Inglés y Español!]","General","2016-07-13T19:48:38","Following discussions with several neighbors who had concerns about the annual cost of permit parking, and the general and understandable angst regarding any potential dealings with LADOT (which would be necessary in order to obtain annual parking permits), I have split the petitions into two.

This first one requests the city install and maintain new solar trash and recycling receptacles along Beverly Boulevard, North New Hampshire Avenue, North Berendo Street, and Council Street.

Additionally, the petition requests the city remove the red curbage from a number of locations where I believe it is not necessary, creating additional legal parking spaces without the creation of any new parking restrictions.  

I will be canvassing the neighborhood as time allows this coming week.  As well as collecting signatures, I will also be polling neighbors as to whether or not they favor the expansion of overnight permit parking in the neighborhood, which (depending on the results of my polling) may or may not be the subject of a subsequent petition.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tras conversaciones con varios vecinos que tenían preocupaciones sobre el costo anual de permiso de estacionamiento, y la angustia general y comprensible en relación con eventuales relaciones posibles con LADOT (que serían necesarios para la obtención de estacionamiento anual), he dividido las peticiones en dos.

Esta primera solicita la ciudad instalar y mantener nuevos contenedores de basura y reciclaje solares a lo largo de Beverly Boulevard, North New Hampshire Avenue, North Berendo Street, y Council Street.

Además, la petición solicita a la ciudad quitar el bordillo calle rojo de una serie de lugares en los que yo creo que no es necesario, la creación de plazas de aparcamiento legales adicionales sin la creación de nuevas restricciones de estacionamiento.

Voy a estar haciendo campaña el barrio como el tiempo lo permite esta próxima semana. Así como la recogida de firmas, que también serán vecinos de votación en cuanto a si o no están a favor de la expansión del permiso de estacionamiento durante la noche en el barrio, que (en función de los resultados de mi sondeo) puede o no puede ser objeto de una nueva solicitud de apelación.

"Alexander Barber","Southeast Hollywood East","Permit Parking District 46 Petition Update","General","2016-06-10T00:03:13","So it took a bit of work but I was able to track down a slightly out of date map of the permit district (overnight parking restrictions and relevant signage now include most of Catalina) that I would like to see expanded to ease some of the endless parking headaches in my neighborhood.  

So it would appear that all of the streets which I will be petitioning for inclusion in the district are technically already inside the boundaries of the district.  

What would appear to be the issue is that there are no overnight parking restrictions in the majority of the district, making the inclusion of streets such as those adjacent to where I live (New Hampshire, Berendo, and the blocks of Council and Beverly connecting them) almost completely meaningless.  

At present the only benefit of having a parking permit on one of the aforementioned streets would appear to be an exemption from the mercifully seldom enforced two-hour parking limit on the street.

So, based on this new information I have obtained I have begun updating my proposal, which will be revised to request that overnight parking restrictions for those without permits and the relevant signage be extended to all residential streets within the boundaries of the district. 

I have attached to this post the somewhat confusing map of permit parking district 46, as well as of my initial (unrevised) proposal, which also includes a request for the city to install additional trash cans throughout the neighborhood, preferably of the environmentally friendly solar trash compacting variety, such as those you may have seen in cities such as Santa Monica and Long Beach, which include recycling and eliminate spillage and overflow issues. 

The additional trash cans are needed to address the large amount of litter that is routinely strewn about our neighborhood, and will assist those neighbors of ours who have worked so hard to beautify the area by planting new trees (which is awesome of them for so many reasons: https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-connected/urban-tree-canopy-benefits-la-communities-some-more-than-others) and maintaining wonderful, lush gardens - only to have them battered with food wrappers and other unsightly waste. 

Any comments, suggestions, criticisms?  If anybody has any concerns about the proposal I would definitely prefer to hear about them now, instead of later on when it would take much more work to backtrack and make revisions.  Let me know!","56"

""Studies have shown that laws aimed at things like 'maintaining neighborhood character' or limiting how many unrelated people can live together in the same house contribute to racial segregation and deeper class disparities. They also exacerbate inequality by restricting housing supply where demand is greatest.""

This city is decades behind in housing supply due precisely to these types of anti-growth laws. At a time when we're adding good jobs in Silicon Beach, building out our rail network, and making constant improvements on air quality, let's not cut off our nose to spite our face. We need to build more housing before the next generation gets priced out of Los Angeles.

1.) More city trash cans in our neighborhood, and 

2.) For an expansion of LA Preferential Parking District 46.  

Prior to going out with my finished proposal and gathering signatures, I'm posting it here to see what my neighbors think of the proposal.  Let me know if you like the plan or not, especially if there's room for improvement anywhere!

Pending a response specifying installation and maintenance costs from the company that makes them (bigbelly), I will be recommending that new trash cans will be of the solar trash compacting variety, such as the ones you may have seen in Long Beach and Santa Monica, and that the older trash cans shown on the map be replaced with the newer more environmentally friendly kind (which are also more resistant to overflow/spillage and include recycling), as well.","16"

"Alexander Barber","Southeast Hollywood East","My recommendations for the June 7th elections :)","Recommendations","2016-05-17T16:24:08","Los Angeles area friends and neighbors, on the upcoming June 7th ballot, in addition to Bernie Sanders of course, I recommend the following candidates!  These are candidates I've chosen based on my own personal progressive (admittedly liberal) values, so If your values differ, remember that they are only suggestions! 

My recommendations are based on candidates sharing my own progressive values and having impressive respective careers of fighting for criminal justice reform including socioeconomic and racial sentencing disparities, prison overpopulation and systemic failures to provide survivors of sexual assault with accessible justice, the right of all women to choose and have adequate access to women's health services, improved economic mobility, LGBTQ and immigrant civil rights, defense of the natural environment, and of course getting money out of politics.

For U.S. Senate: Kamala Harris and Steve Stokes are both great.

For U.S. Representative (34th District): Xavier Becerra (Incumbent)

For Member of the State Assembly: Miguel Santiago

For the judicial elections I recommend the following candidates for judge of the superior court - based on experience, dedication to impartiality, and their respective commitments to using their judicial powers of sentencing discretion to hand down diversionary, rehabilitative, and community service based sentences for non-violent crimes, while (I hope) being tough on corporate fraud and other crimes that are all too often unpunished.

Office 11: Steven Schreiner

Office 42: Alicia Molina 

Office 60: James Kaddo (Incumbent)

Office 84: Susan Jung Townsend

Office 120: Ray Santana (Incumbent)

Office 158: David A. Berger

Side note: I reached out to several of the office 158 candidates to inform myself of their relative commitments to diversionary programs and reducing the inhumanity of draconian sentencing for non-violent offenders, and David A. Berger was by far the most qualified candidate based on both his experience and his reaffirmation of commitment to the same.

Berger has extensive experience working in the Alternative Sentencing Court as a Deputy District Attorney. Mr. Berger detailed his work as ADA of the Alternative Sentencing Court as follows;

""My job is to identify appropriate cases where non-violent offenders who have substance abuse issues, mental health issues, co-occuring disorders (both mental health and substance abuse), can be diverted from the traditional criminal justice system and given the tools they need to stop the revolving door. I also identify and divert Veterans suffering from PTSD often in addition to the issues above, and the Second Chance Women's Re-Entry Court which focuses on the issues facing single mothers. The goal of ASCs is rehabilitation not incarceration...""

David Berger went on to tell me that ""You will probably hear something in the media soon about the latest development in ASCs, which is the Community Collaborative Courts. This now brings together all of the ASCs into four hubs around the County, and expands the range of offenders eligible for these programs. This is something that DA Jackie Lacey has been working towards in cooperation with the Superior Court and the Public Defenders Office. Eventually, it will expand to all the courthouses in the County.""

David A. Berger, based on the correspondence I have had with him, and the depth of diversionary and rehabilitative related work experience - as well as his willingness to correspond frankly and honestly with myself, a young person with whom he has no personal knowledge - proves him to be the most overwhelmingly worthy candidate for Superior Court Office Number 158, and perhaps in the entire present Los Angeles judicial election cycle.

Office 165: Kathryn Solorzano (Incumbent)

Based on the same progressive priorities as the prior two categories, I additionally endorse Jackie Lacey for District Attorney and Mark Ridley-Thomas for 2nd District County Supervisor. 

While Both incumbent candidates are running unopposed, I am still inclined to endorse them based on the exemplary work they have done in the years since initially elected.

Additionally, I encourage my fellow Californians to vote YES on state ballot measure 50, which will enable the state houses to suspend members without pay or ability if they are not doing their jobs. 

I won't get paid if I don't show up to work, and you probably don't either so it is only fair and reasonable that our elected representatives are held to the same standard.

Regardless of whether or not you agree with my recommendations, make sure you get out and vote on (or before) June 7th! :)","60"

"Alexander Barber","Southeast Hollywood East","Why is Los Angeles Spending 3 Million Dollars to Build Cell Phone Towers For Big Corporations?","General","2016-05-25T05:42:00","Before I get any further with this, I should note that I do not, despite several days spent researching the matter, have a clear answer to the question.  If the idea that none of the numerous officials at city hall with whom I spoke were sufficiently knowledgable of the matter to provide a direct answer to my question strikes you as a bit strange, welcome to the club.

So, a few days ago, being a legislation and law nerd for lack of a better label, I was looking over Mayor Eric Garcetti’s proposed 2016-2017 budget summary publication (available at http://cao.lacity.org/budget16-17/2016-17Budget_Summary.pdf) when I noticed something that I thought was a bit odd.  

On page 18 of the budget summary, in a section titled ‘Planning for the Future of our Communities, there is a paragraph labeled in bold ‘Expanding Cellular Capacity’, which reads as follows: 

“The number of mobile users is projected to grow to over 9 million by 2020. The proposed budget includes $2.4 million dollars in continued funding for the co-location of newer and faster cellular technologies on the City’s streetlights.”

A few things about that jumped out at me.  The most glaring of which was a question that I would imagine most people who read the passage would wonder as well; Wouldn’t building cell phone technology be something paid for by, you know… the cell phone companies?  

There is no chance that I am the only Angeleno forking over an arm and a leg each month to a large telecommunications corporation such as T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon or Sprint, or one of the numerous prepaid services running on the cellular networks of the big four, such as Boost (Sprint), Family Mobile (T-Mobile or Verizon), Cricket (Sprint) Metro PCS (T-Mobile), Virgin (Sprint), and countless others. 

We all fork over a formidable sum to access the cellular telephone and high-speed mobile data networks belonging to the aforementioned telecom corporations each month, in addition to a long list of mysterious taxes and fees in addition to the already formidable sum which often do not even go to the government programs and agencies listed on the fees, but I’ll get into the latter portion at another time.

I would assume that all of you, like myself, accept that those large monthly bills - which are severalfold larger than the charges for equivalent wireless services in almost any other country in the world with the possible exception of Australia - are a headache of the working class that, while costly and unpleasant, is the necessary cost of developing, maintaining, and upgrading a state of the art nationwide LTE data network in a big country such as the United States.  

But is that assumption accurate?  Probably not, it turns out.  

According to crowd-sourced internet benchmark company OpenSignal’s January 2016 ‘The State of LTE’ publication (https://opensignal.com/assets/pdf/reports/2016_02_opensignal-state-of-lte-report.pdf) United States telecom networks actually rank seventh in overall LTE coverage per-capita, after South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Kuwait, The Netherlands, and Singapore - although it could not be overlooked that the overall landmass of the United States is far, far, larger than the aforementioned six nations.  

But so, however, is our population, and therefore the pool of bill-paying customers that should, in theory, allow US telecoms to pay for wireless infrastructure that scales equivalently with our overall population.  Delving deeper into the report, it becomes abundantly clear that too, is not the reality.

In the category of wireless data speed, however, the United States ranks in an embarrassingly non-competitive FIFTY-FIFTH place, far below the tiny LTE speed world champion of Singapore, the famously chewing gum devoid city-state boasting average LTE download speeds of 37 megabits per second.  Singapore is small, geographically speaking though, and therefore easier to blanket in scrumptious, blazing-fast LTE.  

But also far ahead of the United States in LTE speeds are numerous countries much larger than Singapore, as well as countries both more and less densely populated than the United States. 

For example, the enormous and densely populated chunk of South America and recent victim of a right-wing corporate political coup that is Brazil comes in 42nd place, at 12 Mbps.  Our colonial sibling, the sparsely populated continent/country of Australia comes in eighth place, with average LTE data speeds of 24 Mbps.  

In 31st place is Donald Trump verbal punching bag (uninformative but SO funny: https://youtu.be/RDrfE9I8_hs), home to over 1 billion people, an enormous and geographically diverse swath of the Asian continent is the faux-communist manufacturing powerhouse of China.  

The former home of Chairman Mao offers its unprecedentedly gargantuan population average LTE download speeds of 14 Mbps - albeit without Facebook, Google, democracy, Falun-Dong, and many of the human rights we enjoy here in the US of A. 

India, also home to over a billion people, comes in 36th place, offering its billion-plus residents LTE speeds of 13 Mbps, which while not quite as fast as China’s LTE, includes both Facebook and Google - all wrapped up in a mostly functional democracy with considerably better human rights protections than it’s northern neighbor to boot - not a bad trade-off for one Megabit of LTE speed, I’d say!

Also defeating the United States in LTE speed is our considerably less economically prosperous former cold-war rival, the bi-continental behemoth that is The Russian Federation, coming in at 54th place with an almost negligible, yet apparently quantifiable lead over the United States’ pitiful average of only 10 Mbps. 

So it should be fairly evident that the United States, the country that brought to the world stage tech behemoths such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Facebook, Snapchat, Intel and Oracle (one or two of whom even still pay at least one dollar in American corporate income tax!) actually sucks at the internet.  The internet which we essentially invented. The United States is in 55th place in providing a technology that WE INVENTED to our own people.

For years, telecommunications firms have bled the American consumer at both ends, looting both the public treasury by lobbying for and in most cases receiving lucrative corporate income tax breaks at local, state, and national levels, all while steadily increasing the cost of services, adding complex and misleading fees to bills, all to pay for improvements to that service that never seem to come to fruition.  

This of course, increases the profits of telecommunications companies and pleases their shareholders, but the American public tends to pay the ever increasing tab, and receives nothing in return, since rate increases and tax breaks hardly ever include any sort of legally binding requirement to actually do anything in the public interest with the public money they receive.

Now, back to the Los Angeles city budget.  Unclear on where to seek further information about the mysterious allocation of 2.4 million dollars to cellular towers, I reached out to one of my favorite and most respectable journalists, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of ‘The Fine Print: How Big Companies Use “Plain English” To Rob You Blind’ (an absolute must-read, by the way), David Cay Johnston.  

Mr. Johnston, as I expected he might, knew immediately which city office to contact regarding the matter, the City Administrative Officer or CAO.  The CAO for the city of Los Angeles is, at present, Miguel A. Santana.  I called Mr. Santana’s office and an assistant of his answered my call.  She was very forthcoming and pleasant, and suggested I contact the CAO IT and internet infrastructure officer, a lady named Claudia (I don’t recall her last name).  

Claudia was also very friendly and knowledgable, and explained to me that while her office was in charge of LA CityLink, which is a theoretical public-private infrastructure investment and incentive program, designed to entice telecommunications companies to bring gigabit fiber internet to Los Angeles.  CityLink took the place of our defunct municipal fiber initiative.  

Municipal gigabit internet systems tend to actually increase competition and local investment, and require only a fraction of the public funding that an equivalent privately funded network generally asks for, and generally repays the public and becomes revenue positive very quickly (which in turn decreases tax burdens for local residents and businesses), all at a fraction of the price-gouging monthly fees charged by enormous, almost universally despised corporations such as Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and Time Warner.

As one might suspect, cable and DSL corporations HATE municipal broadband systems, and allocate large portions of their formidable resources to lobby against and frivolously sue cities and towns home to grass-roots municipal internet efforts, as they have attempted and failed to do in just about every American city that now offers such services, and have successfully done just about everywhere else.  

Chapter Five of ‘The Fine Print’ thoroughly documents the successful municipal fiber internet system enjoyed by residents of Glasgow, Kentucky, and perhaps more importantly, the fierce and underhanded opposition, including numerous costly and frivolous lawsuits filed by telecoms at the expense of the public that the effort had to endure and overcome from telecom corporations along the way.

All I know as of this writing, however, is that Los Angeles had such an effort, and that effort was crushed.  Further research will reveal who or what crushed it, but I’ve got a pretty good idea of who the culprits are.  It certainly wasn’t the internet loving, working class people of Los Angeles - that’s for sure. 

Claudia, the CAO Information Technology Officer, went on to confirm one thing I had already known - that Los Angeles has no free and publicly available internet services in the works, and therefore is not spending any money in the development of one - as well as one thing that I didn’t - the 2.4 million dollars being spent on cellular towers had NOTHING to do with CityLink whatsoever, and that portion of the proposed budget was being overseen not by her Information Technology department, but was - rather bafflingly - instead being overseen by the City Administrative Office in charge of building and maintaining Los Angeles streetlights.  She agreed with me that the departmental assignment was.. strange, to say the least. 

Claudia also directed me to page 614 of the CAO publication supplementing the Mayor’s budget proposal ‘Detail of Department Programs, Volume II’ (Page 614 is actually page 154 in the pdf: http://cao.lacity.org/budget16-17/2016-17BlueBookVol2.pdf).

Here is what that program actually entails (my summary): Cell phone networks, especially with the advent and expansion of high-speed LTE networks, consist of both the recognizable enormous mountaintop signal towers as well as numerous hidden signal boosters.  Telecom corporations often place these signal boosters on apartment rooftops, on road signage, inside church steeples, and inside apartment buildings.  These boosters are necessary parts of a working high-speed LTE network, as the boosters ensure that users will not lose signal when the main tower is obstructed from radio visibility by the terrain and jagged skyline of a city. 

Page 614 contains some additional information regarding the spending, including the not-insignificant tidbits that the allocation is actually for THREE million, not 2.4 as indicated in the summary, and that - in theory - the boosters are to be sold to cell phone companies at cost, which will - theoretically - cover the cost of building them.

We DO need these devices, at least anybody with a cell phone they use regularly does.  As of this writing, on a Tuesday evening, I documented my T-Mobile LTE download speed at a pathetic 4.02 Mbps.  I live on the top floor of a six-story apartment building with an unobstructed clear line of sight for miles.  

I recall using the same ookla speediest to test my bandwidth a few years ago when I was living in long beach, and the same T-Mobile LTE network scored a blazing fast 47 Mbps download speed.  I would assume that the dramatic difference is due to network congestion, of course. 

But who’s problem is that?  Who is at fault?  It’s not the fault of the users who are using the services for which they pay well - our bills are PLENTY high as it is. 

The telecom companies are CLEARLY the party responsible here, how could they not be?  It is the fault of the telecom corporations for succumbing to the greed of their own shareholders and failing to allocate proportionally the revenue generated from the many new cellular subscriptions generated by the growing and increasingly internet connected population of our city to the intensive development of infrastructure required to maintain the quality of service advertised while providing the same to an increasing base of customers.

So, even if LA is going to get back all or at least most of the money our city is to spend on these devices - why is the public expected to put the money up front for it?  And why does the city not intend to earn a profit on the expense? 

I suspect that any economics professor would agree that no private company would spend three million dollars building something that they did not expect to earn a sizable profit on, so this would seem to be - at least at face value - an interest free loan of three million dollars, from the public to the telecom industry.  

As a resident of Los Angeles and therefore one of the financiers of that interest free loan to big business, I can’t help but wonder; Why exactly is this okay? Telecommunications corporations DEFINITELY have the money to shoulder this expense, and Los Angeles DEFINITELY does not.  I can think of a dozen places where that money is sorely needed in my neighborhood alone.  

And what exactly DID kill municipal fiber internet service in Los Angeles?  With any luck I will be able to uncover sufficient information to address that question in my next post.","0"

Los Angeles Police Department Robbery Homicide Division detectives have partnered with investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Alhambra Police Department, Pasadena Police Department and Long Beach Police Department to identify suspects involved in a series of bank robberies which began in November 2015. The most recent robbery occurred in April 2016. The suspects enter the location and pass the teller a note. They demand money and claim to be armed while threatening violence if their demands are not met. In recent robberies, the suspects have become increasingly brazen and have jumped over the teller's counter. Law enforcement is greatly concerned that the level of aggression the suspects are displaying is increasing as the bank robberies continue.

The suspects are described as male Blacks, approximately 25 to 30 years of age. Two of the suspects are between 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall and weigh 170 to 190 pounds. The third suspect is between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 140 to 160 pounds. All the suspects should be considered armed and dangerous.

Anyone with information is urged to call Robbery Homicide Division Detective Koman or Detective Geiger at (213) 486-6890. After hours, please call 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (1-877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).

My name is Kyle and I am a graduate student in public policy at USC. As part of our graduation practicum, several of my classmates and I are working with the Los Angeles Emergency Management Department to measure how preparedness for natural disasters varies throughout the city. As part of this, we've created a brief survey and would appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to complete it. This will help us identify which areas are more or less prepared, and might help you improve your own preparedness!

        ","CERT Level 3 Class Starting April 2nd","Crime & Safety","2016-03-25T03:26:35","Hello Nextdoor residents in Los Angeles;

content has changed...

CERT is the Community Emergency Response Team volunteer organization led by the LAFD. Their training is now a part of Homeland Security; impressive in that the CERT program began in Los Angeles.

 Do you own a Fire Extinguisher? Are you prepared for a disaster?
 There are classes taught throughout the year and all  over the City. See www.cert-la.com

There was an operational issue earlier this week with the web site, but that has been resolved.

Level 1 classes are taught by LAFD CERT instructors (17 1/2 hours)
Level 2 classes (Sheltering) are taught by the American Red Cross (not an agency of the LAFD)
Level 3 classes (Advanced Medical training = EMR just below an EMT) are taught by the American Red Cross and other independent instructors, many who are affiliated with the American Red Cross, American Heart or other authorized providers.  EMT courses also qualify as Level 3 CERT training and are fee-based.

Many CERT members take the initial Level 1 training and continue with CERT Teams and neighborhood groups; some do not.

Level 2 and 3 are optional opportunities to learn more about areas in which CERT members might help in a disaster scenario.  Level 2 classes are FREE; Level 3 classes are fee-based (due to content and advanced instructor certifications).  

Members have choices in how much they become involved after the initial training.  

There are EMT classes (fee-based) 'suggested' by Los Angeles County http://file.lacounty.gov/dhs/cms1_206551.pdf as well as offerings of the EMR class such as the one starting next week.  The venue, while in Los Angeles County (not city), is in Malibu and Agoura locations.  This class will yield certifications from the National Safety Council.

EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE course 
This hands-on, scenario-based training provides the skills you need to help sustain life, reduce pain and minimize the consequences of injury or sudden illness until more advanced medical personnel take over. Upon successful completion of the course you will receive the following certifications from the National Safety Council: 
•	3 year certification in Emergency Medical Response  
•	2 year certification in CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and Health Care Providers 
The course also satisfies L.A. City Fire Department requirements for CERT Level Three, as well as the BLS requirements for California Title -22 certification. Principal Instructors: Erin Huey, Brad Davis 
Dates: Saturdays in April and May, 2016: April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 28. 
Times: 8:00 am – 5:00 pm each day (one-hour break for lunch) Total = 64 hours. 
Location: Malibu and Agoura. Exact details will be provided.  
Pre-requisites: None. 	Minimum age: 16.

While this case was focused on converting 45 static billboards into digital ones, had the court ruled the other way, it would have opened the door to almost 2,000 billboards being able to go digital. Our neighborhoods would have been inundated.

So for all of us who care so deeply about our communities, and putting our neighborhoods first is a top priority of this office, yesterday’s ruling will have a profound and lasting impact.

What is CERT?
Local government prepares for everyday emergencies. However, during a disaster, the number and scope of incidents can overwhelm conventional emergency services. The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program is an all-risk, all-hazard training. This valuable course is designed to help you protect yourself, your family, your neighbors and your neighborhood in an emergency situation.

CERT is a positive and realistic approach to emergency and disaster situations where citizens may initially be on their own and their actions can make a difference. While people will respond to others in need without the training, one goal of the CERT program is to help them do so effectively and efficiently without placing themselves in unnecessary danger. In the CERT training, citizens learn to:
- manage utilities and put out small fires,
- treat the three medical killers by opening airways, controlling bleeding, and treating for shock,
- provide basic medical aid,
- search for and rescue victims safely,
- organize themselves and spontaneous volunteers to be effective,
- collect disaster intelligence to support first responder efforts.

Do not drive over down power lines. Should a power line fall on your car when you're driving, slowly continue to move completely clear of it. If your car can't move away from the power line, stay in the car until help arrives.

If a person or pet comes in contact with a power line, stay clear and call 911 immediately. Do not touch them or the wire.

        ","Message from Mike: Homelessness, Gun Violence, Transparency","General","2015-11-09T22:16:03","My office has been working on an array of initiatives and I wanted to give you an update on three important developments.

HELPING HOMELESS PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET

Homelessness is a crisis that affects every community in Los Angeles. Our office is working to develop innovative strategies to enable homeless individuals to turn their lives around. For example, with the assistance of a grant from Los Angeles County, we are conducting a series of Homeless Citation Clinics across the county. We helped more than 200 individuals at the two most recent clinics, one held in Sylmar this week, the other in Venice a couple weeks ago.

At these clinics, participants can have citations and related fines removed from their records if they perform community service and avail themselves of housing and other key services. Many homeless people who are cited for low-level offenses get caught in a cycle that prevents them from starting new lives. We are helping them break that cycle.

COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC ABUSE

You might recall that Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance and I co-founded and chair the national coalition, Prosecutors Against Gun Violence. Last week we convened a summit in Portland, Oregon, on the nexus between guns and domestic violence. Firearms and domestic violence are a lethal combination. Each week in the United States nine women are shot and killed by their spouse or intimate partner.

Under current law in Los Angeles, any person who is served with a domestic violence restraining order or criminal protective order must surrender or lawfully sell their registered firearms within 24 hours of being served with the order. My Gun Violence Prevention Unit put in place a protocol with LAPD to help identify all domestic violence defendants who own firearms so that appropriate gun prohibitions can be enforced.

At the summit we discussed ways to replicate what we are doing in Los Angeles in other parts of the nation, and explored other prosecutorial strategies and policy changes to make families safer. Prosecutors Against Gun Violence will soon be issuing a report with an action plan to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.

FIGHTING FOR TRANSPARENCY 

Capping an almost two-year legal battle, my office won a major victory for transparency and openness in city government when the Court of Appeal affirmed the right of the City to audit two trusts funded by ratepayers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. This vindicated a critical right of the ratepayers to know how over $40 million of their money has been spent by these trusts.

I have been engaged in this effort since 2013, when I issued a City Attorney Opinion affirming the right of the City Controller to audit the trusts. We subsequently led successful court battles to uphold that right.

Best regards,

Mike","0"

Here in Los Angeles, this serious crime is on the rise. Last year we prosecuted 254 cases of identity theft. In response to an escalating number of arrests, we have already filed 375 such cases since January 1, 2015. That's an increase of 250%.

We have just announced a multi-pronged strategy to combat this dangerous trend.

We are dedicating additional resources within our office to review and prosecute suspected cases of identity theft, including assigning a full-time prosecutor in the San Fernando Valley and Metro Los Angeles as the main points of contact with the LAPD's Commercial Crimes Division. And we are enhancing the nature and scope of our collaboration with LAPD on this key issue.

We are also launching a public awareness campaign to help individuals protect themselves from becoming victims. Examples of simple steps you can take include:

-  Shred all documents containing personal, financial or medical information before you throw them out.
-  Be cautious using debit cards.  Don’t use at gas pumps or for shopping online.
-  Don’t respond to e-mails, calls or texts seeking sensitive information. Legitimate companies don’t seek customers’ information this way.
-  Create strong passwords that mix letters, numbers and special characters, and use different passwords for different accounts.
-  Lock your mailbox.  Stolen mail is a leading cause of identity theft.
-  Don’t keep your license, title and registration in your glove compartment.

K, if this is like once a year, I would understand. But like once every 2 month, they throw a big, loud parking lot party. They even bring a mobile play hose for children and serve foods for like 20-30 people. I tried to talked to them, they just say ""sorry"", ""ok"" but nothing changes. I don't know why but it seems like the tenants of the apartment don't really complain about this. Probably they all enjoy this party? I don't know.. So yesterday, they totally ruined my whole Saturday.

Called the police, they said they came out and talked to them but after months later, they throw a same party again. And then I call the police.. and repeat...

Even the party is over, some guys still hangs there and talk, laugh until 2-3 AM. Police? yeah, they said the came out and told them to get inside and they complied but I didn't really see anything got better.

Any advice? Please?

        ","FRAUD ALERT: Unlicensed Contractors for Home and Yard","Recommendations","2015-06-05T21:35:45","Today our office launched a new public awareness campaign to alert homeowners about fraud being perpetrated by unlicensed contractors. If you are having any work done on your house or in your yard, make sure the contractor you’re using is licensed by the CA. Contractors State License Board. Go to www.cslb.ca.gov and instantly check their license.

Unlicensed contractors are victimizing homeowners throughout LA – devastating them financially, doing shoddy unsafe work, not finishing projects and taking terrible advantage of seniors too. A new scam involves unlicensed landscapers installing drought tolerant landscaping with plants that aren’t even drought friendly and charging thousands more than they are allowed to. Landscapers that charge more than $500 for a project must be licensed.

This fraud is pervasive. In the past year, we have filed 32 cases of unlicensed contractor fraud and are currently collecting restitution on 39 unlicensed contractor cases. Just this week we’ve filed 5 criminal charges against unlicensed contractors too. And there are many charges in the pipeline, unfortunately.

You can read about our efforts to protect homeowners from unlicensed contractors here: http://bit.ly/1Ii5ziE  And attached is list of red flags to look out for when hiring a contractor.

Please share this information with neighbors, homeowners’ associations, neighborhood watches and neighborhood councils. Unlicensed contractors talk a very good game and are great at taking people’s money. But really the only thing they’re good at is fraud.","16"

        ","National Gun Violence Awareness Day","General","2015-06-03T01:08:51","Today is the first ever National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Like tens of thousands across the country – elected officials, celebrities, sports stars, community leaders, teachers, parents and kids – I’m wearing orange today to draw attention to this public health emergency.

Time and time again we have seen how gun violence rips apart our families and communities and that is why preventing gun violence is a pivotal part of the work I’m doing as your City Attorney. Too many kids and too many criminals have access to guns, and as a result, the statistics are mind-blowing:

-          20,000 American kids are killed or injured each year due to gun violence;
-          1/3 of all households with kids under 18 have a gun;
-          Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser has a gun.

Since taking office, I’ve taken several major steps on both a local and national level to prevent gun violence. I co-founded and co-chair Prosecutors Against Gun Violence – a national bipartisan group of leading prosecutors, created a Gun Violence Prevention Unit in this office, worked with LAPD to establish new protocols on domestic violence & guns and have filed safe storage cases against adults who allegedly didn’t lock up their guns which subsequently fell into the hands of minors.

To mark National Gun Violence Awareness Day one of our great partners, Women Against Gun Violence released this impassioned PSA. I was so pleased to be part of it, which implores all adults to lock up your guns. Hope you'll watch and pass it on to a friend:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJsER_frI0M","0"

Today I’m proud to announce that we’re taking an important step forward by joining forces with Nextdoor. Together we can help build a healthy, vibrant and safe Los Angeles – neighbor by neighbor, street by street – so we are thrilled to launch this exciting initiative. 

Nextdoor is a channel through which we can share updates about your specific neighborhood – issues, concerns, upcoming meetings and more. We’ll be using Nextdoor to connect you to the myriad of programs and ways the Office of the City Attorney can help make your community safer and healthier. Best of all, each of our Neighborhood Prosecutors (NPs) – 22 local problem solvers who work within specific LAPD divisions– will also have a Nextdoor presence in their particular neighborhood. This means you’ll not only receive hyper-local news and information, you’ll also have direct access and the ability to share your community concerns with our NPs every day. 

Remember – your Nextdoor website and information is completely private and only accessible to residents in your neighborhood. The Office of the City Attorney and each of our 22 Neighborhood Prosecutors will be able to share helpful information with Nextdoor members; however, we will not be able to access members’ websites, contact information or content. Your privacy and protection are at the very heart of our Nextdoor partnership.

We look forward to using Nextdoor and continuing our work together to build stronger and safer neighborhoods, the direct avenue to a stronger and safer L.A.

Thanks to the professional, heroic and quick work of the LA Fire Department, no life was lost, and no injuries were sustained.

However, the LA Department of Aging, located adjacent to the burning building, had assembled about 2,000 Holiday Gift Bags full of blankets, clothing and small gifts for the neediest of our seniors. Sadly, most of those bags were destroyed.

In an attempt to replace these bags in time for the holidays, the Mayor’s Fund Los Angeles Disaster Relief Program is hosting a charity drive.  If you would like to participate, donations are being accepted at: mayorsfundla.org/donate

All funds will be used to provide 4,500 Holiday Gift Bags to seniors in Los Angeles, as replacements for those that were lost due to the recent fire in downtown LA.  Any surplus funds will remain with the Mayor’s Fund Los Angeles Disaster Relief Program, and will be used for future disaster relief purposes.

These additional firefighters will be deployed at select Neighborhood Fire Stations serving high-hazard brush areas for an anticipated 24 hours, pending further evaluation of weather conditions. These areas include: Porter Ranch; Bel Air / Beverly Glen; Sun Valley / Shadow Hills / La Tuna Canyon; Encino; Sylmar; Laurel Canyon / Mulholland Drive; West Hills / Canoga Park. These locations are based on fire experience, area access and fire potential.

RED FLAG PARKING RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT IN EFFECT

When fire weather conditions dictate, the City of Los Angeles may enact special parking restrictions in areas historically prone to wildfire. These are critical areas (very narrow roads, hairpin turns, and key intersections) where parked vehicles could delay citizens trying to evacuate and delay fire companies attempting to gain access during a fast moving Brush Fire.

This local declaration of parking restrictions is separate from regional forecasts from the National Weather Service.","13"

Please take a moment to learn some facts about the sources of holiday fires.

Facts about home holiday fires:

*  One of every three home Christmas tree fires are caused by electrical problems.
*  Although Christmas tree fires are not common, when they do occur, they are more likely to be serious. On average, one of every 40 reported home structure Christmas tree fires results in a death compared to an average of one death per 142 total reported home structure fires.
*  A heat source too close to the tree causes roughly one in every six of Christmas tree fires.
*  More than half (56%) of home candle fires occur when something that can catch on fire is too close to the candle.
*  December is the peak time of year for home candle fires. In December, 11% of home candle fires began with decorations compared to 4% the rest of the year.
