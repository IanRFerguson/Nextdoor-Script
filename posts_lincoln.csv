"Mallory Fabian","West of Lincoln Heights","Need Gallery Space","Recommendations","12 Oct","Hi all,

I have a dance company and we are having a fundraising event early November and our gallery just backed out. 

We need a gallery space where our new film can premiere and be able to hang up live action illustrations made from a Calarts grad that works with Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. We plan to silent auction these items off and also have a dance installation performance. 

It would be great if the space could be donated but I have a small budget for renting. 
I'm up for anything and everything! 
Please let me know if you know anybody that could help me with this.

Thank you!","10"

This individual will be better prepared to respond to and cope with the aftermath of a disaster.  Additionally, if a community wants to supplement its response capability after a disaster, civilians can be recruited and trained as neighborhood, business, and government teams that, in essence, will be auxiliary responders.  These groups can provide immediate assistance to victims in their area, organize spontaneous volunteers who have not had the training, and collect disaster intelligence that will assist professional responders with prioritization and allocation of resources following a disaster.

"Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT","LAFD-CERT","Advanced First-Aid and CPR Class - Final Day to Register Friday","Subscribers of Battalion 2","5 Sep","Do you know what to do if a loved one has an accident while on a camping trip?
Do you know what to do if a family member feels sick while at home?
Do you know what to do if a co-worker collapses as work?

Do you know when you need to call 9-1-1 or if you can handle the medical issue on your own?

The basic 8-hour First-Aid/CPR/AED class is designed to fit into a work day to meet OSHA requirements.  That class is not designed to teach you to any true level of competence.

The 70+ hour Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) certification is a national certification level that sits just below 120+ hour EMT certification and the national standard is administered by the same group.  While the State of California does not use EMR as a certification level, the training is still valid and various local groups respect it.  The American Red Cross uses this level of training as the minimum for their First-Aid Booths.  LA County Life Guards are trained trained to this level and Police are taught to this level as well during their certification process.

The class we are putting on for you is designed to teach you how to do advanced first-aid to the point where if you graduate the class, you will be competent and capable of working at a first-aid booth (even if that isn't your plan).

You'll learn how to rapidly assess a patient and determine if you need to call 9-1-1.
You'll learn how to talk to 9-1-1 operators and give them the correct information in a clear and concise manner so that they can get the correct resources dispatched.
You'll learn how to stabilize your patient until professional responders arrive.
You'll learn how to hand off to the responders.
And if you don't need to call 9-1-1, you'll learn how to treat your patient (bandage, splint, perform wound care, check vitals) so that a minor injury doesn't become a medical emergency.

The $250 class fee includes the book and National Safety Council EMR and American Heart Association Basic Life Support (BLS) certifications, supplies used in the class, and the contents of your first medical bag.
The instructors and venue are donating their time.

The class is open to every 13 and over and does not require any previous medical training.

Last day to register for the class is this Friday, Sept 7th.

Class schedule is as follows:
Wednesday evenings Sept 12, 19, 26, Oct 3, 10, 17, 24 from 7pm-10pm

September 28 is National Good Neighbor Day! To celebrate, we’re inviting you to participate in the Good Neighbor Challenge. Here’s how it works:

1. Take a minute to do something good in your neighborhood. You can introduce yourself to a neighbor you’ve never met, offer to rake leaves for an elderly neighbor, or clean up some trash in your local park. Your act of goodness can be big or small. You can participate as an individual, family, or an entire neighborhood.

2. Share your act of goodness with your neighbors in the comments below. If you want, you can also share them on social media by tagging @nextdoor and using #seethegood. Photos are strongly encouraged!

That’s it! Although National Good Neighbor Day is on the 28th, you don’t have to wait to participate in this challenge. You can do your Good Neighbor act today. Don’t forget to reply to this post.

The Good Neighbor Challenge is on!","2"

Many neighbors have also had their cars towed in the middle of the night for this matter.

 Summer and fall not only bring hot weather to Los Angeles but also mosquitoes. Mosquitoes can spread dangerous and deadly infections like West Nile virus. 

West Nile virus can cause severe diseases like meningitis (brain infection) encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and limb paralysis.  The most severe illness occurs in persons over 50 years of age or those who have other health problems.  While not all mosquitoes carry this virus, mosquitoes with this virus are found throughout Los Angeles County.  

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is launching a campaign to educate people about the West Nile virus. They are urging people to: 
* Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered mosquito spray, wipes, or lotion when outside. 
* Keep mosquitoes out of your home. Maintain your door and window screens in good condition. 
* Check for items that hold water once a week.  Cover, clear, clean and throw away items that can breed mosquitoes. 

They are requesting your help in sharing this important message with your family, friends, neighbors, and community.

• Usually, homebuyers borrow a large amount of money to buy a home. This type of borrowing is called a first mortgage loan. Also if homebuyers need help with the down payment or closing costs, these loans are called junior loans.
• CalHFA has first and junior loan options for low to moderate income families, including low to zero interest rate down payment assistance loans.
• CalHFA does not accept loan applications directly. A CalHFA approved Lender will qualify you for a home loan, so you will need to apply with one of the Preferred Loan Officers or approved Lenders. You’ll also want to look at the income limits, sales price limits, and other CalFHA eligibility criteria. 
• After you getting qualified by an Approved Lender, then we can help you find the right dream home for you. Interested..? Give us a call at (323) 942-9347 or send us a message to our inbox.

"Community Affairs Stephanie Spicer","Los Angeles Department of Water and Power","Flex Alert Continues: Higher Temps Expected Today","Subscribers of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power","25 Jul","The statewide Flex Alert continues with higher temperatures expected today. Customers are asked to conserve from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., and are encouraged to start earlier if at all possible as electrical use is highest between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m. in Los Angeles. As the heat wave continues, heavy electrical demand and high temperatures provide little cooling time for our city’s electrical equipment and can result in equipment malfunctions. With higher temperatures expected this evening, we encourage our customers to conserve energy wherever possible to help protect the grid and keep everyone cool. Every bit helps. 

Energy Saving Tips:
- Adjust air conditioning thermostats to 78 degrees to reduce energy usage during the hottest hours of the day when air conditioning systems have to work hardest to cool.
- Reduce power use during the afternoon/early evening hours from 2:00 – 9:00 p.m., when energy use is highest.
- Visit the local library, recreation center, mall, movie theaters, or any other air conditioned gathering place to give your air conditioner a rest.
- Limit use of major appliances during peak hours of the day–use washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners and other heavy appliances during the early morning hours or during evening hours.
- Close window curtains, shades or blinds during the heat of the day to reduce the extra heat from direct sunlight through windows.
- Ventilate the home in the early morning and evening by opening windows and doors to clear out the heat and allow cooler air to circulate.
- Turn off lights and other electrical equipment when they are not in use.
- Unplug “energy vampires” like cell phone chargers, DVD players, microwave ovens and other appliances that use energy even when not in use.

For everyone’s safety, check on your elderly neighbors and have a plan to keep your pets indoors and safe.

“When temperatures begin to rise, we can all work together to reduce energy demand. Small efforts by each customer to reduce electricity use really add up and help protect the grid,” said David H. Wright, LADWP General Manager. “We encourage our customers to be prepared and follow simple steps to conserve and lighten the load on electric distribution equipment.”

LADWP recommends the following ways to save energy:

- Adjust air conditioning thermostats to 78 degrees to reduce energy usage during the hottest hours of the day when air conditioning systems have to work hardest to cool.
- Reduce power use during the afternoon/early evening hours from 2:00 – 9:00 p.m., when energy use is highest.

As summer temperatures rise so does the rate of heat-related incidents. 
The LAFD-CERT reminds you to take these 7 precautions to ensure you and your neighbors are able to enjoy the summer weather safely:
1. NEVER leave children or pets alone in hot vehicles! Heat can quickly rise in a car- up to 20 degrees in just 10 minutes! If you see a child or pet in a hot car, call 911 immediately.

2. Check on family members and neighbors, especially those who are older, to be sure they are keeping cool.

3. If you have to be outside, drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and take frequent breaks in the shade.

4. Know the signs of heat-related illnesses.

5. Do not use electric fans when the temperature outside is more than 95 degrees, as this could increase the risk of heat-related illness. Fans create air flow and a false sense of comfort but do not reduce body temperature.

6. Avoid high-energy activities.

7. Check on your pets-bring them inside and provide them with plenty of cool water.
Stay cool!","12"

announce the dates for our upcoming *Summer 2018 Basic Mediation Training*.

   - *July 30 - August 1, 9AM-5PM*

Basic Mediation Training – Comprehensive mediation training and practical
role play exercises in accordance with the CA Dispute Resolution Act
(DRPA). (Location: South Los Angeles)

   - *August 9 – 10, 9AM-5PM (Optional)*

This optional training is an advanced training for applicants who are
interested and available in serving as a volunteer mediator with the
Dispute Resolution Program 8 hours/week (minimum  4hours/week) and
completing the 200 hour requirement to receive a Certificate of Completion.
(Location: Downtown)

Both trainings are offered at no-cost.

Mediation is a valuable and powerful skill that can benefit all aspects of
one’s life.  The Dispute Resolution Program offers mediation services free
of charge to residents of Los Angeles County. Mediation is a method of
alternative dispute resolution available to assist parties in resolving
differences. Through this process, a volunteer mediator serves as a neutral
third party to facilitate communication and assist parties in reaching a
mutually accepted agreement. Mediation is confidential, participation is
completely voluntary, and disputes are typically resolved in far less time
than in the traditional justice system.

The Los Angeles City Attorney Dispute Resolution Program provides an
opportunity for volunteer mediators to become ""peacemakers"" helping
community members throughout Los Angeles build understanding and resolve
conflicts.

The ideal candidate for this training is interested in helping people and
their community, has availability to volunteer as a mediator for a minimum
of 4 hours a week in our office in Los Angeles City Hall, has a valid CA
driver’s license and clears a background check. Bilingual preferred, but
not required.

As of 9:00 a.m. today, LADWP has restored power to 76,000 customers since the heat storm that began Friday; currently, 7,800 customers are without power. Koreatown is currently most impacted with 2,200 customers without electricity. LADWP crews have been working through the night and continue today to repair power equipment servicing the area. Restoration of power to most of the Koreatown customers is expected by noon, the remainder later in the afternoon today.

Lower temperatures are expected to help prevent overloading of circuits and will allow crews to make headway as they work tirelessly to replace damaged equipment. Some customers in affected areas have experienced continued or recurring outages due to strain on the neighborhood distribution equipment. Outages requiring complex repairs may take longer than 48 hours.

Customers are encouraged to continue conserving while remaining safe. Reduce electricity use in the afternoon and evening hours, especially from 2:00 – 9:00 p.m. by setting air conditioner thermostats to 78 degrees and not using appliances like clothes washers and dryers until after 9:00 p.m.​

We appreciate our customers’ patience as our crews get power restored to those affected. Click here for more information on this record heat storm and how to conserve.

Additional overnight crews and cooler temperatures in the late evening and early morning hours helped crews who have been working 16-hour shifts make progress.

As of 10 A.M. Sunday morning, crews continue to work to restore power to 29,350 customers out of LADWP’s 1.5 million total customers. Power restoration crews include staff who have been called in from DWP facilities in Lone Pine, Bishop, Mojave, and Victorville CA, as well as from contract crews.

For customers currently without power, LADWP estimates 24 – 48 hours to restore service from the time the outage occurred.  Some more complex outage repairs may take longer than 48 hours.

Saturday’s peak electricity use exceeded 5700 megawatts, making it the 2nd highest weekend day in LA history. Friday’s peak electricity use reached 6256 Megawatts (MW), setting a new record for a July day.

In Los Angeles, we have one of the best Emergency Services Systems around.  
From January to May of this year, city-wide, LAFD's response time has been 5 to 6.5 minutes from someone calling 9-1-1 to LAFD showing up on scene.

But what happens if 9-1-1 isn't available?  
What if your cellphone says ""No Signal""?
What if it's 3am and the power is out and there's dust in the air?

Do you know what to do?
Are you prepared?
Will you be a victim?

FEMA says we need to be prepared to be on our own for up to 3 weeks after a major regional disaster.
Even on a day-to-day basis, having a little bit of preparation: extra water, comfortable shoes, your cell phone and keys with you at all times, a bag with a change of clothes in the car, etc. can stop a small local problem from becoming a personal disaster.

The Community Emergency Response Team Training is a FREE all-hazards disaster preparedness course taught by the Fire Department to train you to not be a victim.

The next class will be in Glassell Park starting July 11th and every Wednesday until August 22nd from 7pm-9:30pm at the Glassell Park Community and Senior Center (3750 Verdugo Road).

This class is open to everyone 18 and over or 13 and over with a parent or guardian.

"Derek Doublin","Lincoln Heights North","The 5 Units on Broadway","General","Edited 24 May","I attended the City Council meeting the other week and the developer of the proposed 5 lots in downtown LH was there to speak and answer questions. The turn out from the community was... well... sparse to say the least (click on the photo to see the full room). And there were certainly some angry people there.

I figured I should post what I heard at that meeting for the people that did not attend. I should preface that I do not have an opinion on these units at this stage. I am very wary of them, but I just don’t know enough about the projects. I have lived in Lincoln Heights for 10 years and I really don’t want to see it become LA’s new skid row. Although I am not a 50 year resident with a strong family history of living in this neighborhood, I am also not a wealthy person, and like many others here, I don’t want the neighborhood to become a new Silverlake and be forced to move. So the proposal of these new units is complicated, to say the least. 

There has been so much miscommunication as to what these units are going to be and a lot of rumors. I believe that is the fault of the city and Gil Cedillo’s office. The lines of communication coming from the city have been very poor. How can we support something we know so little about?? 

I should also preface that all of the information cited here is coming from a single representative at WORKS, the developer chosen to build these units. How trust worthy she is, is yet to be determined. 

According to the developer, these units are not going to be “homeless shelters” like many believe them to be. Of the 5 units, only a portion of 1 of the units would be dedicated to what is called “Supportive Housing”. The rest would be split up into the following categories: Seniors, Transitional Youth (18-25), Low Income Family and Workforce Families (middle class). To make any of the units available for the homeless, that particular unit would have to be funded by HHH, which is the supportive housing proposition Los Angeles residents voted for in November of 2016. Apparently there is not enough money coming from HHH to make even a single one of these Lincoln Heights structures dedicated solely to “Supportive Housing”. Only a portion of one unit would be assigned to supportive housing. 

Additionally, there will be no “homeless shelters” at all. Homeless housing and homeless shelters are two very different things. The portion of the 1 unit that would be dedicated to “Supportive Housing” will have strict requirements for living there. Unlike shelters and missions, which take people in off the street, these have a rigorous application process. Applicants can’t have produced meth amphetamines in their history. They can’t have committed a crime of violence. They can’t be listed on the sex offender registry. Many of these units would be used to house veterans trying to get back on their feet. 

The funding of these projects dictates what the buildings can be used for. And so the developers have to pull from numerous city pots to pay for everything. The HHH homeless housing fund only covers a portion of 1 structure and all the rest of the funding would come from various other social projects, hence the mixed use of the units (Seniors, Transitional Youth, Low Income, and Working Families).

Once these units are built, however each unit is designated (supportive housing, low income housing, etc.) they would remain that way for 55 years. The developer is responsible for running and maintaining these units for that period of time. 

The use of the units would be open on a first come, first serve basis. If residents of Lincoln Heights wish to try and move there, they may have an opportunity to get in line first due to proximity of the project and early knowledge of when the applications become available. 

Apparently there will be a small portion of the units available for the neighborhood to use as public space. It’ll probably be a small meeting room or small office or something.

As for the parking, since the developer is building on 5 parking lots, they are apparently responsible for building replacement parking for the lots they are building on. The developer would not own or run the lots, which will more than likely be some form of parking garage. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation would run the lots, and therefore they would set the price of these lots. Who knows what that price would be. There was also no mention of how many lots or spaces they would be building. Since this could have severe, damaging effects to the local businesses, we should demand more clarity on this. 

Both the city and the developers have done a TERRIBLE job communicating what this project really is to the residents of this neighborhood. And it sounds like, at times, the city doesn’t even know what it is they are building. This project is currently in the “planning phase” and there are no designs available yet. 

It looks like more information should be coming down the line soon. And the city desperately needs to be more transparent and open about this project. Currently the Lincoln Heights City Council is against these units at this stage, which reflects the sentiments of most of the residents in Lincoln Heights. It is not clear yet whether the residents of the neighborhood have any power to stop these units, but it doesn’t sound like we do. 

I would like to hear more communication from the city about all this, because it seems like we have all gotten mixed signals. I want to see the city put down in writing EXACTLY what these units are going to be. What the developer has told us seems much more appealing than what the city has told us, but who knows how trust worthy the developer’s words are considering they have a vested interested in getting this contract and building here. 

And for the record, Gil Cedillo was “ill” and could not attend this particular City Council meeting. I’m guessing he didn’t want to get hit in the face with a tomato.","8"

Our community is not yet prepared.

You can be.

The Los Angeles City Fire Department realizes that they will immediately become overwhelmed if there is a major earthquake and they will not be able to help everyone who needs them.

You and your neighbors will become the first responders in your own neighborhood during a disaster and the CERT training prepares you to safely respond.

For us as CERT trained community members, we need to come together and plan our response.

We have a chance to stop it.

My best friend and roommate, Ali, has made it her mission to bring this issue to our friends' and  community's attention AND to make doing something about it as easy as possible. 150,000 signatures are needed by JUNE 11th to push an initiative onto the November ballot that would force a reconsideration of this spending. 

Because we’re apparently living in the 1950s in more ways than one, this can only be done IN PERSON, so Ali has been hanging out at various locations around Los Angeles, making it easy for those interested in giving their signature and support to getting this prison-halting initiative on the ballot.  

You can find her at the following locations over the next week:
*TODAY 5/18 Friday 4pm-6pm @ Cosmic Vinyl in Echo Park (2149 Sunset Blvd)

It's so easy - just call our 24-hour Customer Care Center at 1-800-773-2489 and one of our friendly agents will schedule a time for one of our crews to come inside your home to carry out the item(s) at no charge to you!  You will be required to sign a waiver before the crew enters your home. Because it is a pilot, you do have to call... the option for in-home pickup is not available on our website or the MyLA311 app.

Please note that this pilot service is currently available ONLY to residents of Council District 1.  For those who do not wish to have the crew come inside, you can still have free curbside bulky item pickup.

We have moved equipment from the smaller Harbor Yard and are producing mulch and compost again, but at lower quantities. As of May 1, 2018, mulch is available to City of Los Angeles residents at the following self-service sites for residential use only:

   Lopez Canyon - 11950 Lopez Canyon Road
   Van Nuys - 15800 Victory Boulevard
   Boyle Heights - 850 North Mission Road
   Lincoln Heights - 1903 Humboldt Street
   San Pedro - 1400 North Gaffey Street

The mulch currently offered is not partially composted or screened, and as such may grow unwanted weeds or plants.  Once our equipment is replaced, we will go back to our standard operating procedures and our mulch will be back to its normal high quality.

Unfortunately, we will not be able to offer home mulch deliveries for awhile. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you all for your patience.

In addition to our stackable compost bin, we bought a tumbler over a year ago and have been diligently adding produce scraps, dry material, etc. After all of this time, we've still only got a really dank smelling bin that has produced 0 composted material for the garden. I'm at a loss at this point and would love some advice. If necessary, I'd even love to have somebody come over and help us evaluate the situation.

Thank you in advance!

Thank you for your diligence in locking your vehicle doors and removing valuable property from the vehicle.

Continue locking your vehicles and home and do not hesitate to call us if you encounter a suspicious person.  But please do not put yourself in harms way, it isn't worth it!

If you have a chance to take a photo of the suspect vehicle, suspect(s), and/or a license plate, that would be a great help to Detectives!  

We also had a burglary this weekend in the northern Area of Lincoln Heights(RD0401-Look it up on your SLO Map).  The burglary occurred during the day, please place a  lock on your fences(combination locks work best), this will deter a burglar.

I have over twenty years in the restaurant/bar industry and have been kicking this idea around a while but before I spend all my money, I just want to put feelers out there to see if this is something people would be interested in....

Just a few questions if anyone wants to answer.  1. What hours on Saturday and Sunday...(was thinking 9-3)  2. Location:  A restaurant on Pasadena Street by four corners possibly to rent out.  A house in a neighborhood....or a place on Broadway I could rent out on those days.

(Photo: Layla with our pup)

I found your dogs roaming the neighborhood. 2 White pit mixes and a Dalmatian mix who we know as Layla. This isn't the first time we found Layla roaming the streets. The first time we found her she was very very dirty and had a major flea issue. Roaming the streets with no collar and apparent wounds. We took her in, bathed her, and got her a collar (see photo). We continued to take her on our daily walks with our dogs in hopes to reunite her with her owner and express our concerns for her well being. We were fully prepared to keep her if an owner wasn't identified. When you saw us walking her you approached us as if we stole your dog and declined the new collar. 

Fast forward to today as we found her on the streets again with no collar, filthy, and her other pit mix friends obviously have some major skin issues. The point of this post is to ask that you take better care of Layla and her friends. She is the sweetest dog and deserves the best life possible. Not dirty, trapped in your concrete backyard. We have had numerous encounters with your scrappy dirty terrier that you leave wandering the streets barking and chasing everybody down the sidewalk.  This is NOT ok. Once I rounded up all of your dogs out of the street I tried contacting somebody on the property and nobody answered which forced me to enter your backyard to put the dogs back in their pen.

Again, we ask that you take better care of them and if you ever need to lessen your burden we are open to taking Layla and showing her a life that includes dog parks, proper flea medication, routine vet visits, and hikes in the hills. You chose these dogs, they didn't chose you.","4"

This guy would not leave and threatened us up and down, picked up a rock at one point and said we should be “thankful he decided not to throw it”. He claimed to live here and would not leave. Our street is six houses long and I know all the neighbors. We eventually called the cops who searched him and found no criminal record on him. If he showed up again the officiers told us to go ahead and call - two days later he’s back and glares at my neighbors and follows their car. Not sure if cops ever came. Last year on our street there was a phase of cars getting busted into and long story short I confronted the person doing it and I’m pretty sure it’s this same kid. He’s pissed about gentrification as am I but death threats on a small street full of families is not something to let slide.

This program is a way to enhance public safety and respond to concerns about hate incidents and hate-related crimes against members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) community.

""LAPD SAFE PLACE"" is modeled after the Seattle Police Department program ""SPD Safe Place."" The goal is to voluntarily partner the police and community together in solidarity, sending a strong message against all forms of hate. We seek to reduce crimes of violence, harassment and intimidation.  

If interested, you may participate by posting ""SAFE PLACE"" decals at the front entrance of your business or organization as an easily identifiable symbol of support for a non-confrontational environment. We appreciate your education of employees and staff on the ""SAFE PLACE"" concept. You can help the victims of bullying or hate by providing them a temporary ""SAFE PLACE"" to call 9-1-1 or non-emergency public safety lines, until police officers arrive, as necessary. Your organization or company's participation and that of your staff is strictly voluntary.

I have lived in Lincoln Heights for 23 years and never saw a coyote in person until this year. I have seen them on Huntington Drive and on several streets where both my parents and sister live. Be careful! Even large dogs don’t stand a chance against a pack.","7"

"Bryan May","California Office of Emergency Services","State's Attorney General and Top Emergency Manager Warn Of Price Gouging, Urge Public to Report Violators","Subscribers of California Office of Emergency Services in 12 areas","12 Jan","California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services Mark Ghilarducci today released a public service announcement, “Price Gouging is Not Only Wrong, It’s Illegal”, encouraging members of the public to be vigilant against any illegal price gouging in the wake of natural disasters that have affected thousands of Californians. They remind all Californians that price gouging during a state of emergency is illegal under Penal Code Section 396 and encourage them to report potential price gouging to the Attorney General’s website or call (800) 952-5225, or to contact their local police department or sheriff’s office.

“Price gouging during a state of emergency isn’t just wrong, it’s against the law,” said Attorney General Becerra. “We need all Californians to look out for their friends and neighbors as they get back on their feet. One important way we can do this is by addressing any potential disaster-related price gouging on essentials like housing, medical supplies, and food. I am proud to collaborate with Director Ghilarducci and partners throughout the state who are working tirelessly to protect hardworking Californians at every stage in this recovery.”

""California is continually at risk from wildfire and other natural disasters,"" said Cal OES Director Mark Ghilarducci. ""Preying on disaster survivors is low and it’s unconscionable for the survivors of wildfire to fall victim to price gouging. If you see something suspicious with prices of essential goods in wildfire or disaster impacted areas, please report it immediately.""

California law generally prohibits charging a price that exceeds, by more than 10 percent, the price of an item before a state or local declaration of emergency, in the area affected by the emergency. This law applies to those who sell food, emergency supplies, medical supplies, building materials and gasoline. The law also applies to repair or reconstruction services, emergency cleanup services, transportation, freight and storage services, hotel accommodations and rental housing. Exceptions to this prohibition exist if, for example, the price of labor, goods, or materials has increased for the business.","18"

"Nora Petersen","Lincoln Heights Southwest","LADWP Phone SCAM! Beware!","Crime & Safety","Edited 18 Dec","The scammers are targeting local businesses and they almost got me today. I was vulnerable because we accidentally paid our old account using bill pay and we are waiting for LADWP to credit the correct account, so I could see it being disconnected since it has been hard to get this resolved. The person on the phone says you are ""Red Tagged"" for disconnection and then they tell you to get out cash and go to a retail store. I was assuming they had some sort of bill pay kiosk at the local CVS they sent me to, but then the guy tells me to go buy a card from the gift card stand because it will process in 15 minutes instead of 72 hours. That sent up red flags and I said ""the LADWP office is around the corner, I will take my chances and go pay there"" Thank god I did, because when I got there they told me all of it was not true. These scammers are good. They will put you through to a supervisor, they will give you their name and id number, and they mask their number so it matches LADWP! They are counting on the fact that LADWP has high wait times for calls. But remember - LADWP will never call you about a disconnection, they will just disconnect you after sending several notices.
