"Anthony Casado","Adams-Normandie HPOZ","Animal shelter pickup-stray pitbulls","Recommendations","18 Mar","FYI, there are two pitbulls wandering the area right now without a leash and seem to be stray. Have been seen on Kenwood between Jefferson and 29th. Please call LA Animal Services and report the dogs as aggressive at this time. Not that they are, yet, but because of quarantine they are only picking up animals if they are aggressive or injured. They just straight up refused my request when I initially said they weren't. Even though they are still pitbulls so we are all weary. You can call 888-452-7381.","6"

I started an informational website for filming in Harvard Heights but as my involvement with the neighborhood association continues to grow, I have offered to include other pages about things that affect our residents. I have opened this post up to surrounding areas so that as many people get the information that is needed.  There are a few links and resources available about COVID-19 or Coronavirus. Please send me a message here or through the website if there's anything that I've left out. Please include descriptions and information.

Falcor and Vahla would like to remind you Covid-19 is not contractable or able to be caught by your pets. 
Chosen2Serve will still be offering walks, Daycare and private lessons (done in your yard or building courtyard so not to go into your residence during this pandemic)
Regardless of what is happening in the human world, dogs still need walked and trained. The area for Doggie Daycare gets bleached and sanitised twice a day or as needed. Hands get washed with hot water and soap for at least 30 seconds and dog paws get wiped with sanitising wipes and fur gets wiped down with a baby wipe. 
Also, I will do emergency board and train if you must go anywhere due to work because of our current pandemic or (please gods, no) need you to be hospitalised. 
If you are elderly or immune deficient, please message me, I will walk your pups, clean up the waste in your yard or clean the kitty litter pan (if you put it outside your door with scoop, bag and clean litter) you are now my Auntie/Uncle/Grandparent and I will do what I can to help you. 
My mobile is (352) 613-5580","0"
