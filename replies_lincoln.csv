The average lifespan for an outdoor cat is 7-10 years. An indoor is 15-17. If put outdoors they are vulnerable to gruesome deaths by coyotes or being hit by cars. They are also rapidly diminishing our bird population. They kill an insane amount of birds. Our neighbors cat brutally murdered a bird in our bird bath. My husband saw the whole thing. I had two indoor cats‚Äîthey lived to be 17 & 19. They were two of my best friends. Please please please keep your cats indoors.

Then you have some left over at the end of 3 months. Usually you can refill most prescriptions like a week or so before you actually run out. I refill my prescriptions at the first available date allowed. That way I accumulate a few extra each time so I have extra meds in case of an extended emergency and I cannot get to a pharmacy.  
Also, if it's not a controlled substance, your doctor may be willing to write you an extra prescription for your emergency kit.  Be sure to use up the oldest expiration date first. That will guarantee a fresh supply."

Take some time this Saturday or Sunday and pretend you are without water, power, possibly gas and see if you can locate everything you have, and make notes of what you still need. 3 days is simply a rough guideline but depending on your circumstances, you may need many other options. If you have a generator, make sure you can get fuel for it, and remember how to stop-start-and store it safely afterwards (storing it with gas and no stabilizer is a sure way to end up with a tank full of varnish that won't burn.) Even figure out where your candles are, and how many you have.  You can always start by getting a $5 bag of tea lights from IKEA and going from there.  Blue can water for drinking is great, but expensive, and isn't needed for flushing a toilet or washing something.
These days, there are lots of portable options, including a new 12V camping freezer/refrigerator on wheels the size of a cooler.  Or for the more permanence inclined, look at the vast array of RV appliance options that are propane powered (refrigerators, stoves, heaters.)"

"44","John M.","There are online sources of the Honda generators.  I'm sure you could find something through the Honda motorcycle or automobile dealers.
These things are very expensive, around $1000 and the quality is excellent.

There are a lot of competing units out there, some of which are almost as good.  Even Harbor Freight has one, although I don't have any experience with it.  You can get much lower prices with the other brands.  

Be sure to look for an INVERTER type generator.  They are much quieter and use a lot less gasoline than the conventional types, which have to run at full speed all the time to produce 60 hertz AC power.  Inverter models let the motor run slowly when the load is light."

You will have to research to find what meets your family needs. Not everyone has space to run a generator. So think of ways to do without appliances.  There are plenty of outdoor cooking options as have been suggested, but make sure you have a supply of fuel. Use your refrigerated food first, then what's in your freezer before it all goes bad. Then If you have a good supply of canned goods and non-perishable food, you will not need to cook.  Keep plenty of batteries to  be able to operate your flashlights, lanterns, radio, phone (if cell towers have not been destroyed) or other electronic devices.  You can also purchase portable power packs to charge you phone or radio battery. Your vehicle also has means to recharge your batteries if you have the proper cable connector."

"57","Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT","In Northeast LA / Battalion 2, we have community-hosted radio repeaters in Glassell Park, Mt. Washington, Montecito Heights, and Monterey Hills.  We're planning to add another in Eagle Rock and if we find a good location, one in El Sereno.
Currently these are GMRS repeaters (requires a license and a repeater-capable radio) but we're working with a non-profit to purchase commercial licenses.
Part of the plan is to get as many people practicing radio as possible.  
Our Monday Night 7pm FRS net allows people in the area to get experience using their radios every week, test them regularly to make sure that they work, and to know who they can hear nearby (and more importantly to whom they will be able to talk to during a disaster).

If you have an FRS radio, tune to FRS 2-0 (no PL tone) at 7pm every Monday night and see if you can hear ""CERT-47"", net control, running the net.  If so, at the end of the net, when he asks for new check-ins, key up and say, ""New check-in from <community>.""

We use the following format for call signs:
If you are CERT trained: 
CERT-<fire station #>-<STREET NAME>-<sequential #>
For example, my call sign is: CERT-12-CABRILLO-1 because I'm CERT trained, my closest Fire Station is FS12, and I'm the first one on Cabrillo Street with a call sign.

If you are not CERT trained: FS-<fire station #>-<STREET NAME>-<sequential #>
So if the 3rd person on Cabrillo Street has a radio and wants to check-in, his or her call sign would be: FS-12-CABRILLO-3 (CABRILLO-2 is CERT trained)."

We pick the cans because of the 50-year minimum life, plus the individual packaging allows more flexible disbursement around many places in case of things making one or more rooms inaccessible (or fire, or flood, or anything else.) Rotate larger bottles regularly, and keep extra simple bleach on-hand for emergency sterilization (remembering they only have about a 6-month shelf life before they weaken so much, they turn into a sort of salt water solution.) Remember your water heater capacity and toilet tanks have extra storage of potable water.  If it's raining, flip an umbrella and start capturing rain water (just don't leave it uncovered more than 3 days, or you deal with mosquitoes and other contamination.)

:water by the gallon. Anything larger is tough to carry. A couple empty plastic bottles help do the trick to just keep on hand or have some extra water in your backpack .10 cents at Home Depot 
:a variety of led flash lights. 30 lumen pen lights to 2000 lumen spot lights. Plenty of of batteries to power at least half or be able to swap batteries between needed lights. Head lamps with red or blue led settings, don‚Äôt blind everyone you talk to. 
:compass
:cell phone(s) with chargers and mobile battery backups and their chargers too. Along with a power converter for a cars cigarette lighter to plug in non usb items. 
:some rope
:blankets
:any prescriptions you must take
:a decent pocket torch. It will work in the wind and or rain
:multi tool or wrench to shut off any gas valves in your building. 
:pen and paper 
:sanitizer and first aid kit. Side note‚Äîbrushing your teeth, changing into fresh socks and a clean face and body from some wet naps can boost morale and energy that can be just as debilitating for some as a broken ankle. 
:and most importantly, first check to make sure no one is severely injured. Assess the situation clearly. If it‚Äôs clear the disaster is out of your control, accept it and move on with thinking clearly on your next plans of action. Worrying about events that ‚Äúcould‚Äù happen can be self fulfilling prophecies since you burn more energy stressed and do not think clearly and rationally. 

That should be plenty to hold over the start. Other things can be found or swapped later. Sunlight can be your best friend or worst enemy. 

Goes without saying but should be included, your wallet, ID, emergence contact numbers written down on something, car and house keys. Tie them to yourself. You may not need them for a while but you don‚Äôt want to lose them.

I keep a pair of comfortable walking shoes, rain poncho, thermal blanket and first aid supplies in my car as well as some food, water, and basic tools at home.

Well worth the cost, without it it would have been financially devastating.  Lessons learned, keep your keys in an easy to find place.  In the panic we couldn't find my car keys and our car burned in the driveway.  I also have a file box with all of my manuals for computers, appliances, major purchases, etc together and that came in handy when I had to provide proof of items that needed replacing.  Small animals, especially cats may hide in the chaos.  Someone had the presence of mind to grab the cat and the dog and stow them both in a car on the street until everything calmed down.  We are just happy that no one was hurt.  My MW/CP neighbors were such a blessing.  I could never repay their generosity and loving care.  I love my neighborhood and feel privileged to live in a real community.  Help came to us from all kinds of folks in the neighborhood.

"106","Jason C.","Kathleen M. Is right. Unless the feds decide to allow the local prosecutorial agency (LA DA‚Äôs Office) to handle the case, the person or persons of caught will go through the federal criminal justice system. The federal courts located in CA aren‚Äôt bound by the new CA bail reform. Also, this bail reform bill wasn‚Äôt an emergency bill and therefore won‚Äôt take effect until the beginning of next year. Next year will be a boon for thieves, narcotics dealers, and any other criminal that commits a non-violent, non-sexual offense.

"106","Arthur A.","Those claiming there's nothing to steal from a postal truck are dead wrong.  ALL postal trucks and post boxes are fair game for criminals these days.  Some post offices have been hit from the INSIDE -- criminals USPS unwittingly has hired.  There's a reason the USPS locks up (other than leaving a small slit thru which an envelope or two can be pushed through) most of the mailboxes near post offices these days.  

Our local postal carrier had his truck broken into and trays of letter-sized, business-style mail stolen.  They broke the locks to get inside the truck.  He got a brand new truck with much stronger locks as a result.  This was only a year or two ago.  There are plenty of things thieves hope to get from 'mail.'   Yes, the birthday and other checks or even CASH that some people think is safe inside an opaque greeting card.

Then you have the reams of printed material with all manner of data on it pertaining to the intended recipient.  There are those 'checks' attached to bank mailings encouraging people to cash them that relate to opening new credit cards.    When you get those things in the mail, be sure to rip or shred them into tiny pieces as the forms can be filled out using YOUR name and then YOU get the bills until/unless you catch onto the fact that you are a victim.

Government checks may now be the LEAST of the problem.  There are millions still receiving private pension and other checks via the mail.   There are checks for everything imaginable including stock dividends, checks affiliated with cash-back rewards accounts and so on.

Management companies for huge condo associations routinely mail packets of checks to association board members for that all-important 'second signature.'  Then the signed check goes from the association's check-signer to the vendor -- by US MAIL -  who did whatever work was required at the condo complex.  

In a truck of the size in this story, it's guaranteed that packages of all types are inside, too.  Plenty of packages are shipped via US mail, not just Amazon, Fed Ex and UPS.   People are receiving and returning stuff like mad these days and lines are long at post offices as they return things to ebay and similar that they don't want.  

I hope the driver(s) of the postal truck in question are OK -- and yes, they should be armed, like Brinks and similar drivers!"

We said that couldn't be true because we were expecting wedding-related documents/cards/gifts within that 3 week period, and there was nothing outside our door (which yes, could have been stolen) or in our locked mailbox (likely not stolen), so clearly the carrier wasn't delivering our mail (we didn't even have any junk mail in our box). They apologized and said our delivery route is a training route so maybe the carrier just lost our mail. Then they backtracked and said they did hold our mail, but that we just had no mail delivered to us over those 3 weeks. 

We ultimately had to get a signed letter from the manager of that station saying that they messed everything up, and fortunately I was able to use that note to get the fee waived on the reissuing of our marriage license, but we will never know if there were any wedding cards, gifts, or other important documents that seemed to have just disappeared. The couple items we were expecting never even made it back to the original addressee, so we have no clue what could have happened. The manager's only advice was to come in-person to do mail hold requests in the future, as that would make it less likely that this mistake would happen again."

"154","Mary R.","I put my mail on hold last summer for a week, and when it wasn‚Äôt delivered after I got home I went to the post office. They told me at first that it had been delivered, then the supervisor told me it was summer so mail was light and I just didn‚Äôt receive any. Is there anyone we can speak with to help resolve these issues?"
"154","Rashida M.","I wish I could, but my postal worker regularly cancels or ignores my mail hold requests without my consent. It's been an ongoing problem which I've reported to the post office many times."
"154","Mary G.","Me too. Never trust a usps mail hold. Our post office is unreliable."
"154","Conrad S.","Have to agree that the mail is at its most unreliable in my adult life.  Currently, my block is serviced by a half-dozen carriers.  Mail is so frequently misdelivered, perhaps due to the challenging nature of my building‚Äôs addresses which include fractions (‚Äú1/2,‚Äù ‚Äú1/4,‚Äù ‚Äú3/4‚Äù) that I‚Äôve started signing up for e-delivery of everything I can.  It‚Äôs a shame, since I prefer paper statements, and opting-out is likely to hurt USPS‚Äô bottom line, which, by all accounts, is already hurting.  Even ads are being dropped directly into our ‚Äújunk mail‚Äù box, which is clearly not a value-add for the advertisers.  USPS should probably turn off comments next time they want to brag about their services.  For the record, my sorting station is Bicentennial Station and my block is 700 S Mansfield Ave 90036."
"154","ilona S.","Actually stopping the mail is a sure indication that the owner is not home. Don't order packages for the time you are gone.  Have some neighbor  you trust or a family member  pick up your mail every day and park in your driveway and change things in front of the house. Have them  park your car differently every day in the driveway.  Walking around the neighborhood I see people sit in their car and observe houses where the mail has been stopped. When I take a picture of them they drive away and another car takes their place."
"154","Jacob S.","USPS mail holds rarely work all over the city because postal carriers don‚Äôt check for them. Going in person to put in a mail hold or to complain doesn‚Äôt necessarily work either. It‚Äôs because your regular carrier sometimes only works 4 days a week and the ones who fill in ignore holds"
"154","Eve H.","From my experience it doesn't really work.. I have done this several times just recently 3 mos ago and mail was still delivered the entire week I was gone, even after calling USPS while I was on vacation to notify them I was being delivered mail.. It hasn't worked for me"
"154","Jiffy Iuen","I was told by the post office that they didn't honor the online holds (even though it says on the website that they do and it used to work correctly back in 2013/2014). I've also had issues using the yellow cards at the post office. They work about 50% of the time with half of it getting delivered regardless. The last time I went to pick up my mail, I was going to put a new vacation hold on for 2 weeks later. I was told by the person at the counter that they would only hold my mail once as a courtesy. I told him that you could use the vacation hold more than once. He told me it was a ""courtesy service"" from the post office and only allowed once. Which is flat out wrong. So it's hard to trust that the post office (Eagle Rock headquartered) is reliable or clear on the policies."

"154","Donald H.","I guess I'm in the minority here, but I've never had a problem with the USPS mail hold, and I've used it a number of times over the years. That said, I agree that having the mail held signals to others that you're on vacation."

"154","David E.","Last year when I was forced out of my house to do a fire, I can put a hold mail request via USPS Internet website. Well that was a waste of time. So when I contacted the supervisor at the Julian Dixon post office, she informed me that it has to be done in person they do not monitor or honor their request posted to their website. So of course my question to her was then why is that option listed on the website? Of course she had no response. So if you want a mail hold do it in person at your post office and get a confirmation in writing from either the clerk or the supervisor."
"154","Sarah B.","I was told not to have USPS hold your mail when you were going to be out of town then the whole post office knows their is an empty home to burglarize. I think better option is to pay neighborhood kid or family to pick up your mail . Same goes for paper delivery too."
"154","Anna S.","Our house is at the end of an access road and the mail box at the street level. A lot of times boxes that won't fit are left at the foot of the mail box instead of being brought to our porch which is safe and being surveiled at all times. One of those boxes was vandalized and pieces missing! So post office should be more vigilant about not leaving items unprotected in the street."
"154","Pendar S.","Yes, it's a better idea to ask a neighbor. The last time I asked USPS to hold the mail, when I returned, there was a big handwritten sign on the mailbox: ""Do not deliver mail. Occupant is on vacation"" !!!!!!!"
"154","Elizabeth S.","Well, I‚Äôd appreciate my mail to be safe every day when I‚Äôm here!
I‚Äôve had mail stolen. It‚Äôs very frustrating to me that not only do I often receive mail for others which IÔ∏è return but... I get mail forwarded to me from those who received mine by mistake! What frightens me is all the mail that gets misdirected and never sent back
To me.
I had a change of address yet important papers were delivered to my old address.
Thankfully my landlord had my new address and forwarded what he considered important to me.
The weirdest thing that happened was when I‚Äôd mailed some tax documents and literally two days later it was delivered back to me with no
Postmark and no reason why.
When I asked the postman about it he was dumbfounded himself and had no answers.
This caused  my document to arrive late.
The ongoing problem of the postman leaving my mail sticking out of my mailbox is actually the most concerning to me. Yes these mailboxes are old with mail  going directly into the building and some magazines or catalogs are too big to fit easily but obviously the envelopes and letters etc. could be put into the mailbox so they‚Äôd go directly into the house.
Nobody  really cares about catalogs an advertisement if they‚Äôre sticking out easily accessible. But that‚Äôs not what they do.
They bundle all of my mail together and literally leave it halfway sticking out of my mailbox so anyone can come along and steal it.
I‚Äôve called to advise when a serious offense has occurred yet the issues continue with my carriers passing the buck always saying they weren‚Äôt working that day.
Saturday I yet again saw a large envelope on my neighbor‚Äôs step with a note saying wrong address!
I know that we all would greatly appreciate 
If these invasions of our privacy would be dealt with and rectified! Thank you."

Annoying to have to get up at 11pm, shut off the alarm, make sure the cat doesn't escape, open the gate, get the mail, close the gate, go inside, set the alarm, and look at the bills. Not the way to get to sleep."
"154","Carol S.","You can also rent a private mailbox at the Bel Air Mailroom at 2337 Roscomare Road.

Went to the post office to question why mail was delivered....answer? I needed to go on line an place a vacation hold!!!

"154","Kimberly A.","Why does the story about the package returned to China not surprise me? USPS does not train it's personnel well AND does not hold them accountable for their job performances. They have no consequences for egregious behavior towards loyal patrons like the one described by Byron in Noho. This nonsense is rampant all over SoCal. Ridiculous!...and there doesn't seem to be much the average patron can do about it BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES. Maybe the ""union"" is to blame for tolerating and turning a blind eye to such job performance?"

All my 'mail holds' have been processed, and when I returned and went to the post office, everything I was expecting (and a few things I WASN'T) were in a bin, just for me!  I did process the holds in person (if dropping the request into the box inside the post office building counts), and my confirmations were waiting for me with my mail.  One thing to know: If you request a hold, then return to pick up your mail before the end of the hold, the hold is cancelled and your mail will start to be delivered again!

Of course, I have had packages that were literally returned to China - since that was where they CAME from - and it took MONTHS before I received either a credit for the return, or any acknowledgement that the package had been received.  A lot depends on the company and the shipper that is used, which is why I will NEVER purchase anything from "

I've been gone for three weeks.  None of my mail was held.  Thankfully i have a great neighbor and a great friend who collected the mail that was accumulating, including a package with my final copy of my tax return that had every piece of information about me in it to completely screw up my life.

"154","Jacquelyn T.","Regarding those P.O. Boxes:  I have had 2 since moving to SoCal; one, in Mission Hills when I lived in Van Nuys, Valley Village, Sherman Village and back to Valley Village (I was close to achieving 'Gypsy Woman' Status), and one her in Hell A.  

In the Valley, things went well, until they didn't!  A person assigned to sort the mail stopped to answer a phone call, and put my mail on a nearby shelf; unfortunately, I was expecting a document that would allow me to protest a traffic ticket, as well as 2 (TWO) checks, both of which I missed while in 'stayin' alive' mode.  When I finally figured out what happened, I made a personal visit to the post office after being advised (in a joking manner) that my mail had been 'misplaced'..no excuses or apology, even when I asked the Supervisor what the USPS could do to help me get an explanation/extension on my answer to the ticket...""*blank stare*"" just about covers the response!

In Hell A, things went as well as could be expected, even though I got tired of the same drunk and/or mentally deranged folks standing in line, talking loud and making threats (maybe this was the reason for the bullet-proof glass that went up between the clerks and the public).  I had the biggest possible box so my magazines a books didn't get destroyed in the process of shoving them into a smaller slot; unfortunately, one time I was only able to renew the box for 6 months, and returned for the next renewal only to find that the price had DOUBLED!!!!

I smiled as I processed my change of address to my actual residential location, and handed it, and the key to the box, to the Postal Supervisor, telling her ""We've had a good run, but now I gotta GO!""

Refraining from calling folks out of the name given by parents is a good thing; I have gotten all my mail since then, and have recently had occasion to play Postal Carrier for some of my nearby neighbors, since there have been times when I have had a box-full of mail, with only a few pieces belonging to me!

Well, I'd better get ready to move my car...street-sweeping just ended, and there seems to be a LOT of competition between me and the other handi-capables many of whom are no doubt using plaques that belong to ""Big Mama"", if their high-end, and high-PROFILE vehicles are any indication..."

The non-English-speaking carrier (turns out he was an unwilling 'sub' who clearly had drawn the short straw) curtly advised me that he only looked at numbers, not names on mail!  

We reached an appropriate impasse when I showed him that there is a 42 STREET, a 42nd PLACE, and a 43rd STREET...all of which fall under his 'I-look-at-the-number' standard of care!  I have not seen, or MISSED him, since I took my complaints, and the misdirected MAIL, to the post office on 39th STREET and Crenshaw...

I highly suggest that you call 800-275-8777 and ask to make an appointment to discuss your service issues with the supervisor or postmaster. 

If you are going on vacation always have a back up plan such as your neighbor or family member.  If you have a locking mail box that only you and your letter carrier have access to, you could place a note in the mail box that reminds the carrier to hold your mail at the post office.  I also get to know the letter carriers that deliver my mail.  Know them by name and they know me.  These are just my personal suggestions.  

I work for the law enforcement branch of the Postal Service and we deal with external crime.  So please visit our web site at "
"154","stacia crane","Martha,  Since you work there you should know that employees are not to park in the customer lot.  I know that I have to park three blocks away and I work for the Inspection Service.  These are issues that you should bring up with your local management."

I can only suggest that you note the dates and if possible please take the misdelivered mail into your local post office and talk to a supervisor about the errors.  Since your letter carrier only works 5 days a week the supervisor need to know which day the mistake happened so that corrective action can be taken with the employee who made the mistake.  I highly suggest that you call 800-275-8777 and ask to make an appointment to discuss your service issues with the supervisor or postmaster."

They told me that they have been told by city attorneys not to do anything about the encampments because of possible lawsuits brought on by the ACLU.  I know of the ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù drug dealer Robert mentioned.  He‚Äôs a real problem and is hostile.  I took pictures of his previous encampment in the park to send to 311 and he chased me all the way to the alley behind my shop and threatened me.  This last week during the hottest day, a older Hispanic homeless woman was found dead in the park right across from my shop.  When I found her, there were two other guys in a tent getting wasted only a few feet away from her and they didn‚Äôt even know she was dead.  Things are getting crazy.   The RVs are parking in a no Rv allowed area and no one is doing anything about it.  The only help I‚Äôve had is from Park Rangers.  One Ranger that has been the most responsive is named Albert.  He gave me his number and said to call if there are any problems in the park. He can be reached at ‚Ä≠(323) 644-6281‚Ä¨.   Keep in mind he can only take care of matters that are IN the park."

Although it is disturbing, I‚Äôm disgusted to see this neighborhood going down slowly.... we soon will becomes just like the city of Watts, paying higher taxes, and witnessing more drunken people crossing in front of you, more candles light burning on the the sidewalk etc., while the City of Los Angeles are looking for ways to spend the money foolishly.

Truly, there is notting we can do.... we can chants loudly, but what good that will do? 

The City of Los Angeles and many other cities, ignored the problems; because the problems had become a bigger problems and they do their best to looks aways themselves.  

Ya, sure they‚Äôre planning to help homeless, but how many years has this been going on?

The problems is growing and they knew it.... all this could have been prevented if they had the love to help get rid of the problems several years ago when they saw homeless people sleeping at the park, MTA bus stop, RV parking around our communities, homeless people sleeping on Valley Blvd behind the bushes, sleeping underneath the bridge, the list can goes on

Unless it is their neighborhood they personally live in, I promise you they will push for power and make changes to the communities like our formal LAPD Chief Daryl Gates. 

Meanwhile, we should all work hard, and keep calling our City Councilman Office, and other cities sources, since they are one of the biggest problems in our community who don‚Äôt answer phone or return calls.... they loves their pay check, but hate serving our communities. 

Oh, get this.  If you go into to their office and speak loud, not yelling because you are hard of hearing they will call LAPD immediately, and somehow they arrive within 10 minutes, not knowing they had arrive for you.

- If you use the MyLA311 app to report, it creates a log of the complain and the person supposed to take action become accountable. if you see they haven't followed up, you can send a complain using the reply you got from the app and the issue gets escalated. That is a tool we all need to use and make the responsible parties accountable. 
- If you call parking enforcement, ask for a protocol # or a complaint # and if they don't follow up on it, call again and make a complaint using the #.

This is my little plot of land I was able to obtain and I‚Äôm not cool with someone pissing on my door, walking past human shit, seeing people smoke glass at the park, or sell it 50 feet from my front door. Have you been to the park lately? Seen the tweakers? The beds in the restrooms that dudes go in with women? And maybe I should of worded it better, but the problem really is the substance abuse/selling that‚Äôs coming with the homelessness. I can deal with a drunk person here and there...but we are way beyond that at this point. There‚Äôs a difference between complaining that there isn‚Äôt a Starbucks within walking distance and this.

But it is just as unsafe as a parked car with windows cracked in this heat. I wish I could teach pets and kids to just spray mist on themselves, but that‚Äôs a ridiculous notion and not helpful unless you‚Äôre in your 20‚Äôs, and are an adult human that can leave their apt and sense when the heat is actually making them sick and can do something about it. Please advise. Thank you officer"

"212","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","I don't know what to tell you. Cool Showers also help to cool the body. A wet cloth around your neck helps also. 
If kids are too young to teach them how to use a spray bottle, they are too you to be left unsupervised.   Perhaps you'll need to arrange for them to be somewhere that has air conditioning."
"212","Kim A.","Thank you officer. Just hard to pay for a luxury like that, whether it be kids or pets. But I know it‚Äôs not your problem or fault, and I sincerely appreciate your thoughtful response. God Bless!"

"212","Joanna Lenn","Number 5! Wow! Okay - if a fan is making me feel cooler, but not really lowering my temperature, how is that more dangerous than sitting in the same room, but with no fan? Are you saying a fan will give me a false sense of security, and lull me into allowing myself to get heatstroke? That seems outlandish.  Like saying let‚Äôs all stop taking planes, because plane crashes happen once every zillion flights. Why should people basically torture themselves when the chances are so incredibly slim that they will be hurt by their FAN?"

"213","Sheri Okamoto","We have used the Raid that is made for wasps. The can shoots a long spray so it should be able to reach your eaves (if it‚Äôs a single story). Just shoot and run."
"213","Ari Bustamante","I‚Äôve used the hose on its most direct setting"
"213","Maria Lu","I whacked the one I had on my porch and  ran inside until the wasp left then I made sure I stepped on it to kill anything inside. I' ve had this happen before and one year I did not do anything once I knotted it down and there were  babies inside."
"213","David Eaves","Actually if they're not bothering people they're good to have around.  They eat lots of other bugs."
"213","Linda Torn","Eco Smart Wasp and Hornet killer is a Raid alternative that is as effective. Plan out the spraying so you don‚Äôt get sprayed and can get in the house quickly."
"213","Timothy Wager","Thanks, everyone, for your advice!"
"213","joAnn Ortiz","If you feel the need to have it gone for future safety, spray it down with a hose on it's stream setting. Do it in the early morning and then avoid the area for a bit if they make you uncomfortable. Maybe scoop up the remaining nest (later) & take it to the far end of the yard where you & your toddler don't go & let nature (ants) handle any possible eggs/larvae. They are so beneficial to the ecosystem it would be a shame to simply kill them, not to mention using any kind of poison near your family in general. Be a good neighbor to them üôÇ

You'll also want to look up in all of your eaves to make sure no other nests have started. Kind of like with swallows, if you knock the nests prior to them laying eggs they will move on to more hospitable territory. Good luck!"
"213","Sani Abdul-Jabbar","I used the following product on two large nests, and it worked like a charm. Use at dawn or dusk when the wasps aren't very active. Also make sure that kids and pets aren't around.

If they don't get the attention they seek, they might try again, or even a few times, but eventually they get bored and go away.  The more we criticize or reprimand them the happier they are.  They epitomize the saying that negative attention is better than no attention at all."
"219","Dana E.","James K.; I am curious if you are subtly trying to support Chris W.'s opinion that he expresses, and you don't have the guts to actually say it? Your misguided argument that his comments ask for or invite a discussion shows either simple ignorance or an unfortunate intention to make the same derogatory statements. Such statements, phrased in language that is nothing but antagonistic, serve no purpose except to cause devision. Devision does nothing but increase the divide that already exists so sadly in this country."

This program has provided them with opportunities to develop life skills, has build their academic and behavioral strengths, has provided them opportunities to build great relationships, has provided them opportunities to give back to our community and has given me and our staff at El Sereno such pride to attend their breath-taking graduation ceremony and to see their positive growth! Parents, please consider this program for your children even if they don't have an interest in entering a law enforcement career.  It's well worth it!

We are hit year after year with rate hikes which the LADWP claim will be used to update and strengthen the power grids.  Yet year after year outages become more and more frequent.  
Los Angles is a global city and a key part of the global economy yet we are forced to live with a substandard power supply. 
I do not see other cities around the country being subjected to the frequent power outages anything close to what is happening in Los Angeles.
The use of the term ""Heat Storm"" by LADWP is a blatant attempt to deflect blame.  This is SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. of course we experience extremely hot summers!   I have lived here my entire life.  The temperature isn't to blame.  It is the massive development without the necessary power upgrades and maintenance.  Each time there is an outages the LADWP slaps a band aid on and tells us that's just the way it is."

Touting that only 2% of population is affected, in the second largest city in the US is unacceptable! Coining jargon like 'heat storm' is designed to deflect their incompetence. Why can't they just own it and then go about fixing the problem? DWP should be completely overhauled.

I DO believe the best solution is a merit-based compensation plan and poor-performance punitive pay reduction for every single DWP employee.

Further...in light of the repeated annual outages, we should offer a 100% tax CREDIT on purchase of medically-necessary power backup systems, a generous tax credit for any backup system (graduated percentage increasing from gasoline to battery) and graduated public assistance for medically necessary cooling devices - both a/c and medical refrigerators.

There are irrefutable, solid data showing that air-conditioning and refrigeration are amongst the most influential technologies of the 20th century which allowed population settlement and growth in hot, semi-arid and arid regions (of course with transportation of potable water).
Public agencies ignoring these facts, or exploiting them, depending on your personal ideas/ideology, is nevertheless inexcusable."

Also, many areas have 'cooling centers' set up specifically to shelter folks who would otherwise suffer heatstroke, or worse, without a place to get cool (I wonder whether THEY also lost power???).  Check 311/211 for the locations in your area.

 Notice lower case' Has a 6 billion dollar income from YOU and ME! The fact is they knew it was going to get hot. Lets face it they havent mantained any of the out dated pole transformers at all. They are the original  circa 1920! So they knew it was going to get hot and everyone was going to turn on the AC. So they didnt call in extra crews and just let the transformers blow! IE INSURANCE! Then you and I the paying customers with no other option, except solar, Which few can afford. Do you think for one second that this would happen in any other city in the country ,you are sadly mistaken my friend. I grew up in Oklahoma City. The crews were on 24hr call at all times 24/7. So when you say taking a nap to finish his shift maybe so. But there should be no reason to take a nap! There should be a crew to replace that crew. Therefore you go home and go to sleep in a bed. so that you can wake up and go back to work with real sleep under your bely instead of being half out of it and climbing a pole and making a mistake and frying yourself.

"225","Nanette G.","I am a solar installer and I noticed some people mentioned that solar cannot help you in case of a blackout, so I just wanted to clarify. 

With a traditional solar system, if the grid goes down, the solar system automatically shuts off. This is a safety mechanism to protect lineman who are working on the grid because any unused electricity from your solar system flows into the grid, which could put linemen in danger.

There are two solutions to actually be able to use your solar system during a power outage. 

1) Purchase a battery backup system. This way, your excess energy is stored in a battery, which you could access electricity from during a power outage. 

2) When choosing your inverter (one of the main solar system components), you can choose one by a company called SMA which included a power outlet which you can plug an extension cord to and run it into your home for a little extra power during the outage.

If you have any questions about solar or how it works, feel free to reach out.

Our AC broke yesterday at about 4pm with inside temps at about 75. By the time I figured out the problem, got the part (capacitor) and replaced it at 7pm, my house went up to 88 degrees. Took till midnight to get it below 80 again. Our house is '50s ranch style with about 50% modernized for efficiency (dual pane windows, some upgraded insulation, newish ac system etc).

As for our city failing at being able to provide adequate electricity, I call BS. This is our 3rd summer living here and it has reached 110+ temps every year. Why is this current temp such a surprise shocker? Considering how much we pay in taxes and utilities, there is no excuse for this predictable failure.

invest in that independent ocean water system used n Australia, Israel and to a  lesser extent  in SanDiego. We have known for decades  that we  need to strengthen  our electric power grid and expand it's capabilities, We have fires the likes of  which are beyond belief, but no our State Democratic Governor and Legislature would rather use our money for their own personal choices and we get short shrift year after year.  But  the results, are just terribly hazardous and costly for the rest of us, while the State gladly support all the illegal immigrants coming across our boarders daily. Of course we all know that is for their Political goal. Living here for 56 years and paying every tax and fee,county City State and Federal imaginable, I would vote them out, if the chance ever comes. If they had billions more  income to waste, with the elimination of Prop 13, we would see no change they would still not spend it to permanently avoid these problems. THEY ARE OUR PROBLEM NOW!! Their approach to governing is feed their insatiable need to spend to help  their big developer supporters and the Hollywood Entertainer contributors!!! THEY MATTER!"

"229","Louie M.","It would cost billions to upgrade the current grid just to cover the two days a year there is a potential for outages.  In addition to the cost there would be thousands of scheduled service outages during construction. Someone (us) would have to pay for the upgrade too so unless you want your bill to increase substantially we should all do our part to conserve when demand is high.  It sucks to not have power, I get it, but let's be realistic with our expectations of the utilities. Additionally, solar will be mandatory for all new construction starting in 2020 and Title 24 energy code is already mandating low consumption devices in new buildings.  I doubt spending billions to upgrade while they are losing money to solar is high on LADWP or Edisons priority list.  

Like others have said, you can lease solar for less than your power bill is and, while you would still be connected to the grid, you wouldn't be completely dependent on DWP especially if you added a Tesla powerwall or equivalent. There are options."

The outages have been longer than 24hrs, your cs reps tell useless if factually inaccurate information from one customer to another. No clue how you are prioritizing crews and locations but clearly it's not being done by at risk population with temperature modifiers. There was a spectrum crew sitting on their ads waiting for your crews on golden time to do their thing for hours. 

I understand heat wave, and breakdowns, and Murphy's law... but YOU have some explanations to give.

Why in the holy hell would tell the city that upzoning CAN be handled with out current grid? Why in the world are YOU spending billions of OUR dollars for powerlines to oregon when YOU cannot even maintain the ones you have HERE? For half the cost you can build a manmade island off the coast of LA, powered by ocean and solar exclusively, that will provide some power to the city, a crap load of water for green space to cool the area, replace air cooled condensors with water cooled ones (100% more energy efficient), and not have to send crews for power repairs up and down the western seaboard. Btw your spin Dr that said only a little will be lost during transmission from Oregon and it will be neglible is a moron.

LADWP Heat Storm Update

July 7, 2018, 10 P.M.

LADWP crews working to repair damaged cable in the 5400 block of Fulton Avenue

With another triple-digit day of record-breaking heat, electricity demand and additional outages, LADWP has increased its estimated restoration time from 12 - 24 hours to 24-48 hours, with restoration work on some more complex outages potentially taking longer than 48 hours.  Unrelenting weather conditions and high energy demand continue to strain equipment, ranging from underground cables, to overhead power lines, as well as larger-scale equipment including overloaded power distribution stations and related equipment. Power restoration crews have been called in from DWP facilities in Lone Pine, Bishop, Mojave, and Victorville CA, as well as from contract crews to assist LA-based crews working 16-hour shifts around the clock to restore power to all affected customers. Saturday's peak electricity use exceeded 5700 megawatts, making it the 2nd highest weekend day in LA history.

As of 10 P.M., localized power outages are affecting approximately 37,000 LADWP customers out of 1.5 million. Since the heat storm began Friday, LADWP crews have restored power to nearly 20,000 customers with an average outage duration of 11 hours.

In the Metro Los Angeles area, Beverly Grove is down to 19 customers affected from 2,000 without power earlier in the afternoon. Other communities  with the most customers impacted are: Westlake with 4,600 customers without power;  Koreatown, 4,900 customers; Los Feliz at 3,300 customers; and Exposition Park, Echo Park, Silver Lake, Larchmont, Hollywood and Hancock Park ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 customers without power.

In the valley area, Encino is down to 78 customers without power, down from 1,400 customers this afternoon. Sherman Oaks has approximately 1,600 customers without power.

Below is a breakdown of the outages as of 10 P.M.

During periods of excessively hot temperatures for extended periods of time, electrical equipment can become overheated as customers typically operate air conditioners around the clock, increasing the strain on neighborhood power distribution equipment. We appreciate our customers‚Äô patience as our crews get power restored to those affected and we continue to urge customers to reduce their electricity use in the afternoon and evening hours by setting air conditioner thermostats to 78 degrees and not using appliances like clothes washers and dryers until after 9PM.

Click here for more information on this record heat storm and how to conserve. If you need to cool off, the City of LA offers cooling centers where you can beat the heat.

To report a power outage, customers should call 1-800-DIAL-DWP. To check the status of an outage, visit our outage maps at "
"229","Michael B.","Electricity has gone out in part of my house   Could it be due to heat?"
"229","nandu h.","Sheri, I didn't mean to imply you were nasty. You weren't. You were actually very civil. I was referring to the ""F"" Trump comment. Sorry if I didn't make that clear. 
I just noticed Mr. Hanock's post. Sorry, my bad.  I don't think he directly blamed immigrants for the weather but yea, he did get a bit off topic to say the least.  The climate or weather as we used to call it has nothing to do with anything political, immigrants, Bush, Trump, my house, my dog or my golf clubs. You were on point Sheri and I was not even close. Take care and stay cool. All the best. Jonathan"
"229","Jonathan K.","Connie, the logical extension of your argument (not bringing more kids into the world) is that the human race will eventually die out. Not sure if that's the best solution. With all due respect, I think going solar and the Tesla battery are better ideas. And of course recycling and all that good stuff. With that I agree..."
"229","Jonathan K.","Remember parts of Puerto Rico are STILL without power. Take the kids and go sit in a movie theatre. It‚Äôs tough at night to sleep but remember there are plenty of people without AC that do every night."
"229","Franklyn G.","Nandu, if that's the case, I believe you tripped a circuit."
"229","Jonathan K.","Has anyone used swamp cooler or evaporative cooling air conditioning? I have just learned about this being best for dry hot climates and regular ac having a harder time to cool these temps. Not only would it be less a strain on the grid it‚Äôs better for the environment and more affordable then regular ac units but why doesn‚Äôt DWP advocate using these here as well as other big companies that should be making them? "
"229","Cece L.","Cece, I asked the same question. I don't think the climate is quite dry enough to have them here. At least I think that's the case. Better than back east of course but not like Arizona where they're very common.  I do come across them on occasion at a few of our County buildings but very, very rarely. They are very simple contraptions and fairly easy to work on."
"229","Jonathan K.","I would particularly like to thank the people in this Thread who have blamed  President Trump who has been in office for 18 months when we all know that DWP has charged  very high rates for uncounted years and yet the infrastructure especially in the Studio City Sherman Oaks Encino Beverly Glen and Laurel Canyon has been aging and in need of undating for years."
"229","David Z.","Ps. Btw thank you DWP field workers who are out in this heat to keep this old system working."
"229","David Z.","@DavidZ-NO ONE blamed DT for this, I just read through the thread, the comment directed at DT was about being a climate change denier NOT causing the outage. If you thin DWP's rates are extra high try living in So Cal Edison territory, their rates are much higher. The bottom line is when demand is high there things unfortunately happen. I do not like it either."
"229","Patricia P.","Cece I was told that that the problem with swamp coolers is that the climate in the Los Angeles area is actually much more humid than it used to be when there were less people less pools etc. So installing a swamp cooler may make the humidity in your house approach 100% without providing the wanted drop in internal temperature"
"229","David Z.","Cece, my sister lives in Desert Hot Springs and has 2 air conditioners. One is an evaporation cooler for when the heat is dry and a refrigeration cooler for the humid heat. The evaporation cooler does a great job at keeping her house cool when the air is dry and is much less expensive to use. One of the problems we have is being so close to the ocean and with that comes the humidity. I suppose an evaporation cooler would be OK some of the times. Give it a try."
"229","Martin K.","How do I get LADWP out of my life? I‚Äôve gone solar, I have panels, but we still have to go through DWP to get our power through our panels. How does this work?! Do I have to get a Tesla battery?"
"229","Teresa B.","Teresa, As I'm sure you are aware you are connected to DWP for your night time consumption and use whatever ""credit"" for power generated by your panels was ""given"" to DWP during the day which is why your DWP bill is (or should be) low. 

Tesla powerwalls (or equivalent) would instead store the energy you generated during the day and you would use that power at night instead of grid power. You should probably stay connected to DWP in case several cloudy days in a row don't generate and store your power requirements."
"229","Armond S.","They still supply you with water and bill for sewer and trash so there really is no getting rid of them entirely."
"229","Armond S.","@Armond thank you! I didn‚Äôt know powerwalls worked like that. Definitely time to invest in one."
"229","Teresa B.","Marie - I checked a few sources online to find the optimal selections for my programmable thermostat. The higher you turn it, essentially, the longer it needs to cool to bring it back down. It depends on how long you will be gone versus how long to bring it back down. If you are gone all day, for example, you may save more keeping it at 85. They generally suggest 76-78 for when you are there and 7-10 degrees more when you will be away for the day."
"229","Anabel Battenfield","Everything Armond said is correct. There are much better options than Tesla. I would recommend an LG or Sonnen 10kwh battery. 
That will set you back about 9500 bucks. 
There is an Self Generating Incentive program (sgip)rebate that‚Äôs worth a few thousand dollars. 
It‚Äôs best to just wait a few years when it‚Äôs half that price.  If your system was designed properly you should only have 22 dollar 2 month Ladwp bill like I have."
"229","Robert C.","Latest LADWP update closed off comments section. lmao."
"229","Enrique Arteaga","We need to recycle more.  That will solve everything that is wrong in the world today.  My goal is to recycle every democratic and get a republican in return :D"
"229","Joseph D.","I was in the valley and the restaurant had these evaporative coolers. We were on a enclosed patio. Company was ""Cool-A-Zone."" They work pretty well but I noticed that if you weren't sitting right in front of it, you didn't feel anything. The upside is that they are completely self-contained. Just plug in and go. No venting out the window like those portable A/C units. Not sure what the amperage is so if you went that route just make sure you won't pop a breaker. Can't imagine they use a lot of amps."
"229","Jonathan K.","we have swamp coolers.  You fill them with water and it cools the water and has an internal fan.  They are not as good as ac but if you point them directly at yourself they do help and don't pull a lot of electricity.  They don't have to cost a lot either."
"229","Debbi W.","Saw y‚Äôall working on Western My block was fine and now is out, solid job ü§®"
"229","Scarlett B.","Thank you for that! My husband and I are on sleep apnea machines and we can't sleep without power! Hope this doesn't happen again scary thanks DWP"
"229","Deb N.","Me too! I have a sleep apnea machine and am going to my parents! Thank you for all the work you do!"
"229","Sendita L.","We are still without power ! 50 hours now! Please get out here DWP!"
"229","Brian Fritch","Two nights of no electricity in the blistering and painful heat is too long. Accurate information was not provided. With the amount of money DWP charges to the residents, I can‚Äôt believe that it didn‚Äôt have the bandwidth to deal with this type of ‚Äúheat storm‚Äù, especially when we ALL have been notified of it. I have a senior mom and a disabled husband, both experienced a medical issue during this ordeal. I had to spend money on things and on days that I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily do. I had to dispose all of our food in the refrigerator. Aren‚Äôt you aware of how expensive groceries are these days?!?!? üò°Everything is costly! I will be seeking reimbursement for all my expenses and what ever was in my fridge. I better not get any excuses about it!"
"229","Maria M.","I feel so bad for all of the people without electricity. I don't have any answers, only deep sympathy. How horrible!"
"229","Ann Bostich","And when the pyramid scheme that is Tesla goes bankrupt what do you do?"
"229","Mirren H.","Marsha, every friend I know with Edison is thrilled. They actually pay less and keep their power on."
"229","Mirren H.","How come nobody mentions the thousand of new apartments, condos and houses being built all over the city.  What will happen when they start using water and power. Hopefully the DWP will prepare for this."
"229","sylvia h.","Make sure your home is well insulated, good  insulation  is better than having solar. And with all the solar panels on people's roofs you would think the power being pumped back into the grid would help."
"229","Pete P.","Yeah, for the price of electric you should give us all generators. We should never have brown outs"
"229","linda m.","Oregon looks better and better"
"229","linda m.","Hi Pete, insulation,LED Lights and any energy efficient upgrade is fantastic for reducing consumption but it doesn‚Äôt make electricity. 
When combine with solar it makes for a perfect marriage. Just like me and my wife üôèüèº. 
If you size your system properly you‚Äôll get a 22 dollar bill just like I do. 
Did you know that about 42% of are water goes toward producing energy at power plants. So besides being a clean renewable source of electricity it‚Äôs saves massive amounts of water."
"229","Robert C.","All this talk about solar, et al is great but maybe don‚Äôt make us feel bad about not being able to get solar because our roofs don‚Äôt meet installer‚Äôs specifications or the fact that many of us may not have the 10 grand laying around to upgrade the electrical on a house that was built in 1908. Going solar doesn‚Äôt change the fact that LA City council approves building permits like they are handing out halloween candy to any developer that conveniently makes a campaign contribution and its putting tremendous stress on an old grid running 1970 tech."
"229","Enrique Arteaga","Exactly Enrique. You still have to plug in to DWP anyway."
"229","Mirren H.","For sleep apnea folks, I saw this product, dunno if it is any good or not. 
It‚Äôs all fine and good for the city to have cooling stations during the day, but folks with sleep apnea need their CPAP machines running, for some folks it can be a matter of life or death. 
Perhaps the city should look into opening Red Cross shelters with cots for CPAP and other electricity dependent medical devices during major power outages. 

"
"229","Angie K.","Enrique your absolutely right solar won‚Äôt change what the LA City council does or world hunger or many other ills of the world üåé 
But what it does do is let me control my energy cost from my own personal Power plant that sits on top of my own roof ! It‚Äôs pretty empowering being able to tell LADWP just how much money I won‚Äôt be paying them every month.  But your so right Enrique, you do need a decent roof and a good electric panel."
"229","Robert C.","How is business use of electricity taken into account on these ""unprecedented peak electricity demands?"" Their air conditioning equipment is far more massive than any home air conditioning units yet homes are the one always being blamed. Without these air conditioning units people would not be able to work or barely survive the day. Solutions?"
"229","Nina G.","Marie - just saw your questions in terms of leaving on the A/C while you are gone or turn it on when you get back. I too had this wondering and Googled it and it looks like the general consensus is to turn it off when you leave and turn it on when you get back (even though it will run several hours). The philosophy behind this statement seems that an A/C unit is better off running for a long time than multiple times during the day (20 times each 20 minutes vs. one time multiple hours). Also - if you have a Nest like I do you can - on your phone - turn on your A/C on the way home from work (if you haven‚Äôt programmed it to follow a schedule). That way it is not 100+ degrees when you get home but somewhat more comfortable."

"230","Peter Spoto","@Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT, 

The class I attended last March taught me the meaning of ‚Äúsituational awareness.‚Äù I am not referring to some aberrant fear and misguided paranoia, in which I spend my entire life waiting for disasters and catastrophes to ‚Äúrain down upon us.‚Äù

I am speaking about not feeling ""helpless"" if emergencies or disasters strike.

Instead, I feel great peace, tranquility, and a sense of empowerment, knowing that even the smallest physical contribution or knowledge sharing during a community-wide emergency may ripple out from me, bringing lasting , positive results in outcomes for the living and for life itself.

Sign up, folks! You will not be disappointed!"
"230","Lettie Ibarra","Actually the definition of victim according to Websters Dictionary - (1) : one that is injured, destroyed, or sacrificed under any of various conditions a victim of cancer a victim of the auto crash a murder victim (2) : one that is subjected to oppression, hardship, or mistreatment a frequent victim of political attacks"
"230","Ge M.","""A ""victim"" is someone who is unprepared for a situation.""

I believe this sentence does not accurately communicate what you intended. (If I had been ""prepared"" to be choked until I was unconscious and had a seizure, all while being raped, would I then not have been a 'victim?' Or perhaps it wouldn't then have happened??) Please reconsider."
"230","Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT","My intent is for people to take a class that teaches you to maintain situational awareness and be equipped and prepared for the unexpected. 

The training tells us that we don't want to bring a victim (someone who gets injured or harmed) to an incident. 

The reality is that while the training helps you to be less likely to become a victim, no one can guarantee that you won't ever be one.

The simple fact is that people rely on city services, expect those services to always be available, and those city services will not be available during a disaster.

If anyone wants to twist my words or take offense at the statement or claim I'm defining something I'm not, I apologize for the misunderstanding but that is not the intention."

"240","Beatriz Mejia","Don't call 911 for fireworks unless it's an explosion of course.  Call 1877 asklapd.  When you call 911 for fireworks you are tying up the line for someone who may need police, fire or paramedics for a life threatening emergency.  I know it's frustrating, if you can pin point where it's coming from call your senior lead officer Monday and also inform them."
"240","Sakae Koyama","Hi Beatriz, the PD that we met with on Thurs said it was ok IF we know the location. The call gets routed. We asked if it would tie up the lines too. That's what we were told."
"240","Linda Mann","Thanks for clarifying, Sakae. 
Nola, any results?

I called 911 earlier tonight to report a specific location. Placed on hold, then very nice operator said she would route to dispatcher. The dispatch operator took the address, asking if I knew how many people were setting them off. I also told her about those we are hearing West of Alvarado, explaining I didn't have an address. She said she would report that also. Just getting it recorded is good, I hope."
"240","Beatriz Mejia","Linda I believe when you say route you to an operator, you are being transferred to the secondary line... Non emergency.    Sakae, thanks for the info...I was just on the LAPD communications Facebook and it clearly states not to call 911, but you are only sharing what you were told.  Thank you.  (Signed 911 operator for 24 years)"
"240","Sakae Koyama","Thank you Beatriz for your long 911 service. I too am very hesitant to call this line for fireworks. The recommended number is STILL the non-emergency line 1-877-275-5273. Maybe one day, we will have a dedicated fireworks tipline? Lord knows we could use it. The officers who told us to call the line said so ""unofficially"". I hope people will use their discretion."

"240","Linda Mann","Beatriz, Yes, I was transferred to the non-emergency line. Ordinarily I would not have considered calling 911 for fireworks, but there was conflicting information floating around, and as I did have the location where fireworks were being set off I used 911. Since LAPD is supposedly cracking down on illegal fireworks this 4th I thought perhaps using 911 was part of the plan, since it's use was encouraged by officers."

What I want to know is if the cameras inside the metro trains work and if the driver sees a major problem does  he/she call the police and what is the response time. I am just asking since my friend had her expensive bike stolen from the expo/bundy station during the day and when the police arrived at the metro station after she called them they told her the cameras around the bike area don't work and they refused to take a report telling her to go to the WLA police station to file a report.

I'm a volunteer teacher at a nonprofit in skid row that is housed in Apts. built by the Skid Row Housing Trust downtown.  The numbers are soaring and we have a crisis because homelessness has been kicked down the road for years.  The homeless are too easily demonized and dehumanized.  As a life long street dog rescuer I got involved with the homeless when I started to notice people on the street taking better care of their animals then themselves.  Their lives had a level of purpose and heart that really touched me.  Now three vets that I contacted offer free or discount vet services to the homeless I bring in.  Even though it's a little thing and just a few those few are doing better.  There's no monetary profit in our capitalist society so I applaud all and any efforts to slow down crime and save even one person when NIMBYS and too many good people complain but don't do anything or get their hands dirty."
"241","Burton R.","34 of 1076 rehabilitated means 97% refused services.  Our city politicians view of the homeless problem is that it is primarily economic.  If it was economic 97% would be asking for service.  In reality we have emptied our prisons because of an ACLU law suit over jail overcrowding.  We have made drug usage and theft under $1000 misdemeanors.  We have made tent camping legal on city property.  We have severely constrained the power of the police and maximized the civil liberties of the homeless.  We have made our bed and we must face the reality of what we have created.  Honestly, I see no solution in sight.  But I am very happy La Bron James is a Laker."
"241","Devyn H.","I certainly haven‚Äôt seen an improvement with the homeless population. There are encampments all over Woodland Hills where there never used to be. Just a couple of months ago, the woman was attacked in her car by a homeless man on Topanga. Drive along Burbank Blvd by the basin, the south side is basically one large encampment. It‚Äôs the same all over the city."
"241","Stephanie M.","I‚Äôm sure these statistics are accurate, presented in the framework of this program.  However, you need to provide other #‚Äôs, even if they are not pleasant.  Can I ask you what the % increase was of home, biz and car burglaries in Los Angeles County, over this same time period?  I don‚Äôt know about my neighbors, but I have started considering moving out of LA due to this.  It seems out-of-control.  Is it bc the penalties for these crimes have been reduced?  Also, I feel the police only come if there is something like a homicide happening.  The apartment building behind me started cutting my trees w/o my permission and were coming in my property.  I asked them to stop until I cld get input from my gardener whether this was a good thing for the trees or not.  They wld not, and the apartment manager got nasty.  I called The police and they never came...  they called me like 4 hours later to see if it was still important by then everyone had gone and the trees were cut...  I feel that I rarely see direct benefit from taxes and I feel unsafe."

It says ""Metro Multi-Agency Contract"" and it starts off talking about Bus Operator assaults, so of course that has nothing to do with house burglaries, etc. And everything to do with all things on the Metro.  No wonder you can't get anything done.  You know who to talk to about what post
 And you wait until someone post on social media on another subject to take the easier route to respond to them with your gripe. Instead of picking up a phone or typing an email or letter with your personal information so someone who has the responsibility to actually do something about it. (SMH).

"241","Lawton B.","As a mom whose daughter made her Metro debut at the start of high school, I am very pleased that this progress is being made! It is our young people who are choosing public transportation over owning a vehicle for the sake of ease, cost and for the sake of the environment. The safer it gets, the more people will ride. My daughter loves Los Angeles, and has seen so much of the city by bus and by Metro! Thanks to our police and Metro employees for all they are doing and for keeping her safe onher journeys!"
"241","Julia Griswold","Really!  The young girl should not have had her feet on the seat.   I think she disrespected the officer and everyone on the train with her use of words.  She doesn't have any respect for her elders.  I didn't see anything that the officer did wrong.  He told her to take her feet off the seat. Her mother should have told her not to put her feet on the seat. I would hate to have to sit on a seat that someone had their feet on.  The young girl was totally out of order.  She needs to apologize to everyone on the train for causing a disruption."
"241","Joyce G.","Joyce, absolutely not a reason to use excess force. That‚Äôs so absurd. Are you saying people should be arrested for putting their feet on the seat?! 

I understand that she is wrong and perhaps there were other ways for her to Interact with the officer but she was not breaking any laws. If so he should‚Äôve cited her. 

I‚Äôm appalled at your answer. It‚Äôs frightening to think that people condone this kind of behavior. 

I do not feel any safer riding the train knowing law enforcement ride the trains. In fact, last year I had a panic attack from witnessing the way LAPD was talking to a visibly mentally ill man who was talking to himself on the train. I seriously thought they were going to hurt him. They were overly aggressive. 

I‚Äôm glad some feel safer but I can‚Äôt say everyone does. 

These kinds of unnecessary policing can lead to deportation for some people in our community or the criminalization of homeless folks who are already struggling to get by. 

I guess how one views this depends on their experiences and morals. There are no easy fixes for any of these issues..."

My 12 year old alerted me to the Coyote and we both watched him through the kitchen window and he looked at us. He eventually went back down the steps and left. I was surprised on how comfortable the Coyote was since they are very skittish around humans.  The fact that he was so at ease and got so close to the house and humans is not a good sign.

My 2 small dogs almost got attacked had it not been because I called them back into the house quickly. They were just in front of my house with my husband as he kept an eye in them while doing their business, as they quietly came out positioning themselves for an attack. I heard my husband in a panic so I came out to see what was going on and realized the 3 of them were spread out, so I quickly screamed at the dogs to get in the house. Weird thing is how neither of my 2 dogs knew they were there. I have a chiweenee and she is so on guard that even from the backyard she knows when someone is walking up the front or on the sidewalk with other dogs. Had she see the coyotes, she would have run towards them barking at them. Thank God we got them in in time and avoided having them see the coyotes. The hide up the alley street and church parking lot on Bellevue between Edgeware and Kensington, should you be out walking your dogs in this area. I have seen them in the early evening so don‚Äôt be fooled by the time, they can come out any time of the day. Walk your dogs with a leash."

But clearly she shouldn't be one to talk because she OBVIOUSLY isn't attending meetings herself.  The last meetings on this subject were standing room only with people out the door.

I don't trust the developer.  Those who have attended the meetings in the past know Cedillo say there mocking and laughing at the community.  He passed these projects under the radar thinking no one would find out about them.  When he found out about all the community push back, he withdrew all 5 properties.  Why?  It was just 3 months before the election and he did not want to lose. He got reelected and then resubmitted them.  He has lied time after time about his promises regarding these buildings and now the community has ZERO say because city council passed a resolution blocking public comment, which is protected under state and federal law, from the process.  It's foul what Cedillo is doing and all because these developers have contributed funding to his campaign.

I'm against these projects for a few reasons.  For one, our parking lots are needed to keep our businesses afloat. We were told at the meetings that these parking lots are underutilized and when these lots are at capacity daily.  Additionally, if you look at the numbers, our districts already has 800+ supportive units.  We have the second most of any council district.  Five districts don't even have 60 or 70.  BUT they want to dump 5 of the 12 developments in our neighborhood?  Why do we have to take 40% of the load?  It makes zero sense.  I looked at the charts showing the breakdown of homeless people per neighborhood.  Do you know that we aren't even in the top 10 or even top 14 neighborhoods with the most homeless?  Koreatown shared those figures.  Then why are we taking 40% of the load?  There are 13 council districts and they are dumping 5 of them here.  

They need to go find public land or other public lots that are underutilized because ours are most definitely NOT underutilized.  

This process is corrupt and Cedillo is not doing his job, which is to represent the position of his constituents.  He is following the money like a hungry desperate dog and walking all over us.  

We need to recall him.  Enough is enough.  He called is racists and bullies ON VIDEO because we are opposing these projects.  Who the hell says that?  He has some serious issues.  It's disgusting."

Do these actually work!? 
I think they are a good deterrent bec it would make the thieves‚Äô lives harder and it would take them a longer time to be able to take the vehicle which might be ample time for someone to see them or for them to give up and walk away or not even start in the first place. And that‚Äôs why I use it.

But, coming from the Police, is it remotely true? Are they effective? Or should I also add a kill switch type protection?

"275","Robyn H.","Officer Gomez, I'm reaching out for advice. Unfortunately its been 2 months of posting to 311 and even once we had to call 911 because the homeless addict who has set up camp across the street from my home punched a fellow elderly neighbor. I wish I could say 311 was helping but I'm loosing confidence. We have seen cal-trans come out on multiple occasions (presumably responding to the 311 reports) and it has not lead to any effective result. Once there was a number of police cars and a huge Cal trans truck that pulled up and it looked like they would get the encampment to move out but he ended up packing up moving down the street for a few hours, only to unpack again that evening as soon as Caltrans left. I realize this is a chronic problem in LA and that Caltrans and the police may be overwhelmed with limited options. it just saddens me as I know our street not long ago was a very safe pocket. All the neighbors know each other. Many have lived here for multiple generations, every other house is full of young children and since this encampment has popped up we have seen needles on the street not far from where children play or ride their bikes, we have seen drug dealers drive up right outside our window to sell him heroine and meth, we have had an increased number of transient nefarious traffic on our street and it feels like the safety and quality of life has taken a nose dive rather quickly. I have posted this on 311 as have many of my neighbors already. I even called and left messages and emailed the lead case officer at the Hollenbeck station after Officer Alvarado (who answered our 911 call) advised us to, but I still have not received a response. I've seen the cops come up the street a few times and Caltrans too but they have had no luck at getting this addict out of here. I'm so saddened for the children on my block as it's no longer safe to ride their bikes like it used to be. All this in the last two months... I also have compassion for addicts, my husband works in psychology to help folks with drug and alcohol addiction but I don't know what else to do to mitigate this issue. It's become a threat to our neighborhood. I'm writing with hope that you can help."

WHY the change???? We vote on occassion not on a daily basis so why the need??????? or is it a Need??? voting in ones neighborhood is the most convenient AND assures  higher voting which the city of LA  Need!

"311","Judi F.","I am concerned that it is hard enough to turn out the vote even when voting locations are right in voters' immediate neighborhoods. Aggregating centers makes them less convenient for almost everyone and thus may lower the turnout.

"311","Suzann R.","So the reason that we are asking this question of all citizens is that it is very difficult for those that work to get home and vote, specially when they have to travel over an hour to two hours away.. if you work in Los Angeles and live in the Antelope Valley you can go to a ‚Äúvoting center‚Äù in Los Angeles and you will be able to pull up the ballot for the area that you live in and place your vote. You no longer have to worry about getting home in time to vote. This of course does not affect those of us that vote from home this will stay the same. So the reason that we need to change is that it is broken because people are not able to cast their ballots. Having a voting center will enable us to be able to participate more in our rights as US Citizens. Unfortunately voting from home on our computers is definitely not going to work as it is too easy for people to breach a personal computer."

"
"311","Harvey L.","It sounds like another bureaucratic boondoggle which will take take away the community nature of polling places. It will make it more difficult for many to vote. It will create a system, regardless of any safeguards, which can be easily hacked, by the Russians,  the North Koreans or any high school kid with a strong back ground in computing. The current system is fine. If people do not care enough to vote on election day or to obtain a mail in ballot maybe they should not vote. A ten day open period to vote could easily lead to a situation of voter regret. Where someone votes for candidate X one week and a scandal breaks out the next.  By the way, the county being the county, I have no doubt it will waste millions in tax payer funds."
"311","Rhys M.","Is that so all the illegals can vote too?"
"311","Norm R.","That sounds both very  useful and very expensive.  People will need to be paid, to monitor each vote center.  Additionally, they will need to be in possession of a voter register, to validate that each voter is, who they say they are."

"311","Matt C.","So it gives you a paper backup but this is another method for electronic voting if I got that right‚Äî""You cast it on the same device!"". That's bad in my opinion. I believe it's been made pretty clear that electronic voting has been proven to be insecure. I do think that something needs to be improved. Firstly going to a church to vote is going to send a message to certain voters to vote in a particular way. I don't think a church is a neutral territory for voting. Also, on the last election, the church I was assigned to vote at had a complete failure to pull it together and couldn't even figure out how to hang a sign on their locked fence to explain where all the voters should go. It's a mess and need improvement but voting from an iPad is a concern to me."
"311","Suzann R.","Norm we get paid to monitor our polling places now no difference."
"311","Jen Martinez","This really saddens me to see more waisted taxes on things we don‚Äôt need. Build our community. We need senior centers where they can socialize and workout. We need more books and computers classes in our Library so our children can become successful.
Our softball fields need to be redone so that our kids can keep practicing year round (without the dodgers coming in and putting conditions on the fields)Keep the soccer fields for just soccer. Stop using our parks for housing for homeless. Put bike paths around the perimeter of the parks so kids can workout with getting hit on street bike lanes. 
We don‚Äôt need machine for ballots. Just for scanning because look what you all said last election that it was hacked.
Many people who pay taxes want to leave Los Angeles because they can‚Äôt afford it here. It‚Äôs very disappointing when you burn though billions of dollars and foolish things that are not a necessity.
Our people are what matter,  young or old. We need to workout to be healthy , mentally and, physically. The outcome will be:                                                                         We make better choices in our lives and it becomes a lifestyle for healthier families. Which means less mental and physical abuse in homes. Less alcohol and drug abuse.

For those of you who wonder why this change is needed, one reason is that a voting center is open for 11 days, not just on election day, which makes it more convenient for busy people and people with transportation issues to go there. Most of our current polling places, like schools, rec centers, or churches, can't accommodate that lengthy disruption to their programs."

If this is a true voter emergency then open the polls an hour or so early so people can vote before work.  Just curious...what is the cost of this fiasco?  Will there be more voting locations in Santa Clarita or less?  What percentage of people don‚Äôt get to vote because they are at work and where did this stat come from?  Are you creating problems for the masses to accommodate one?"

How many millions of our tax dollars are going to go into implementing this new ""convenient"" system? 

Let people vote by mail or the convenience of their own computer, but leave the polling places as they are for those who don't like/trust/use computers. If everyone could sign into a secure server and vote, I'd wager those huge lines at polling places would be cut in half, and the whole process would be easier and less stressful for all parties concerned.

"311","Matt S.","Last year a combination of moving and re registering the new address, not getting a mail in ballot, and pending travel out of the area on election day, caused me to utilize early voting at the Voting center in North Hollywood the weekend of before the election. 

It was a complete zoo. The line stretched clear across the adjacent park.  I waited almost 6 hours to vote. I'm impressed with how many people stayed in that line because they wanted to vote (which ever way). But I hope this proposal is not going to institutionalize that six hour wait.  Many said they didn't get their mail in ballot.

There are a quarter million people living in the Santa Clarita Valley, and the nearest ""voting center"" was either in Palmdale or North Hollywood. For the Santa Clarita area I would suggest the City's activity center because it has ample parking.  A second location might be one of the libraries."
"311","Ruth H.","As much as I dislike the idea, I realize that..."
"311","Karen G.","I thank the county for considering a change.  I had not realized that we were behind the times until I went to Nevada to help campaign for a candidate.  Voting was much easier there.  Early voting Centers were open late and on weekends in drug store chains, grocery stores, and libraries. ...places with easy parking and familiar to most people.  Voting by mail was the other option.  It seemed to me a huge improvement over our early voting at the registrars office and the same day many poling places in people's homes, crowded golf courses and retirement homes with no extra parking,, etc."
"311","Tim J.","We already have a fix Karen and it is mail in.  Haven't we all learned this lesson in the recent past of anything electronic.......  Everything on a computer is hackable period - PC, phone, Corp. Gov. - it doesn't matter.  The is no way to completely secure any of this including the electronic nonsense we currently have."
"311","Val P.","This does not feel right. Especially the same day registration. It will make illegal voting much easier. Where vote now is just fine."
"311","Kevin M.","This is such a terrible idea.  Getting rid of local polling centers and sending everyone to a ""convenient"" mega-center will disrupt everyone.  It will only be convenient for the election officials, the places chosen will be inconvenent for most.

Worse, the idea seems to be to encourage absentee and early voting, two trends which damage our democracy.  To the extent possible everyone should vote on the same day with the same information.  Too often some late information comes out that would change votes, had they not already been cast.

I suspect there is significant partisan advantage in this."
"311","George P.","I believe that the set up and system we have in place is perfect. If you are an informed registered voter you can either vote by mail, or set your alarm clock on Election Day and go to your local polling location and cast your vote. It doesn‚Äôt get any easier than that. 

A question for you county folks. Why do you feel the need to or attempt to make the voting process any easier? Any individual who is a concerned registered voter can either choose to vote or not. 

A suggestion, why don‚Äôt you go door to door and let people vote from home and when they do, give them a little goodie bag, place their I Voted Sticker on for them, pat them on the head and tell them, job well done."
"311","Joan D.","Any and all may vote by mail. People either are lazy and/or don‚Äôt care enough. So if they belong to either of these sorts they have no right to even have an observation or opinion on any election."

registration.  Your just asking for voter fraud."
"311","Judy R.","Dumb idea.  It isn't broke and does not need fixing.  We can vote by mail, or go to a local polling place.  If they want to ADD vote centers so there are more polling places in highly populated areas, fine.  Just don't delete community ones that people are used to.  BTW  I live in a rural area and have to vote by mail.  I have no choice as there is no designated  polling place for me to go to. I usually drop my ballot off on election day at a polling place in the city of Santa Clarita.  Feels more like voting."

"311","Nils D.","Clearly, vote by mail is better. So just do that.

The other aspect a lot of people are missing is the 11 days of voting. The way I look at, in order to vote you have to spend your most valuable resource: time. Taking a bus or car to a vote center costs you more time than walking to a polling place. But not all time is created equal. Election day unfortunately isn't a holiday, so that means taking time off of work, which might not be realistic for everyone. Having 11 days to schedule around will make voting more possible for people working one or more jobs."
"311","Robin L.","Love this. It modernizes an archaic and over capacitated system my mother helped create OVER 50 YEARS AGO!  This also allows same day registration, expands voting days, allows more accessibility, and if you look on the map, you‚Äôll find that most sites are at our local library.

"311","Shelly Y.","You need to have a voter center that has free parking! It is ludicrous that the ones in my area never have parking. It discourages voting. Voters also should have a day off so they do not miss work. If there are ridiculous holidays off like Columbus Day, there definitely should be one for voting."
"311","Bruce M.","We have multiple countries using hackers to undermine our security, Corporate espionage uses hackers, Terrorist use hackers, Some of our own brightest young minds are hacking. If the FBI, CIA, Wall Street, Banks, Colleges and Social Security (a joke) can be hacked, how is this a good idea? Centralized vote centers requires a massive logistics plan to hand both vehicle and foot traffic. Mail in has proven to be flawed when 100k military votes where dropped from count. Leave it alone."

"311","Marlin O.","I don't know the difference -- apart from the terminology -- between a polling place and a voting center. Re-branding, or more substantive?

"311","Francoise M.","A solution in search of a problem? What's wrong with the existing system?"
"311","Kevin M.","Near as I can tell, they want to take the thousands of local precincts and combine them into about a dozen polling places.  I suggest they use DMV offices, as the experience will be similar."
"311","Diane F.","I appreciate the ability to walk to my local polling location. I also enjoy visiting with neighbor's along the way. Since when is voting about convenience! If someone feels 'inconvenienced' by the current system, perhaps they could try democracy in Cuba or Iran. 

It's amazing to me, after all of the babbling rhetoric concerning 'the Russians' interfering with our elections, that anyone in our statewide/county bureaucratic boondoggle would even consider voting by computer or cramming voters into 'centers' with long lines and bad attiudes. 

Leave it alone! We love voting in our neighborhood!

By the way......Same day registration? Is that a part of California's sanctuary state, pandering to illegal aliens, law? This is the most corrupt thing I've ever heard of. It must have been thought up by Kevin de Leon so that the illegal half of his family could vote for him, his buddies, and their tax sucking socialist agenda."

Since then, I've been in n out of depression and struggling to find a permanent job, so i can get back on my feet. I'd prefer to work at home, to save money on commuting and a wardrobe I can't afford. But even work at home jobs are hard to land.

"318","Denise L.","Hi Trina,   I have been an 'Inspector' for the elections for about 13 years now.  You would probably start out as a 'clerk'.  The work is only when we have an election.  You could probably do it without a car, if you had a ride.  You attend a training class prior to the election which is 2 1/2 hours.  They are held at various locations, and you can usually find one near you.  The day of the election, you arrive at the precinct location 6;00-6:30 am and are there until 9:00-9:30 pm.  So, it just depends on if you would have a ride for those two days.  They would place you in a precinct that needs clerks, so, it could be anywhere."

It shows corrosive disrespect for the actual choices we voters have made.

"318","Rina R.","Philip H - I've been working for the past few years as a Precinct Inspector and want you to know that, actually, someone can't vote more than once by going to different locations. If a voter isn't on the printed voter rolls for the precinct (or is listed as having been sent a vote-by-mail ballot), they can cast a ballot but it's provisional, meaning it's put aside (in a bright pink envelope!) until all ballots are collected for the county, and then all of those are compared. That's why final results aren't available until long after polls close. 

Of course there are probably errors out there, and determined fraudsters, but the California system is pretty safe in general."

The VOTE is our most sacred right and duty as Americans. Everything should be done to ensure that our elections are free, fair, secure, inclusive and convenient.  We have all seen news coverage of long lines of working people disenfranchised by purposefully difficult polling hours, facilities and locations as well as gerrymandered districts.  These ‚Äúlegalized‚Äù means of manipulating elections are a greater threat to our most basic definition of America than the few individuals who steal a vote.

"318","Wendy Y.","As far as voter fraud, it‚Äôs easy to ‚Äòcheat‚Äô. You just give a name on their list, sign that name on the line, and they give you a ballot. You don‚Äôt show any ID. People know names of others who they know won‚Äôt show up because 1) they‚Äôre dead, 2) moved out of state, etc. 

The voting rolls are not purged of those people. 

The state does not compare signatures. Why would they? They can‚Äôt cancel their vote because they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs their signature! They‚Äôre not handwriting experts! 

It‚Äôs all the honor system. It‚Äôs abused. 

Soon, CA is supposed to go to a all Vote-by-Mail system. For better or worse."
"318","Elizabeth W.","Wendy Y, a correction -  California has NOT passed legislation requiring all counties to conduct only Vote-by-Mail elections.  Unless and until the state passes new a new election law, the election process will remain a county decision.  Two things to consider:  1) Yes, it is possible to cheat and say you are someone on the register and vote as that person - a felony.  There is an immediate risk that one of the poll workers knows the individual.  To make a difference in election results there would have to be massive collusion. 2) California permits same day registration, which makes mandatory Vote-by-Mail a little more complicated."
"318","Wendy Y.","Thanks, Elizabeth for the correction and clarification. 
Is the poll worker authorized to challenge that person who is signing for someone else? They can‚Äôt ask them for proof. To me it sounds like a chance in a million that the poll worker  would know the person. I have a feeling people take their chances. They are willing to risk it. Just my hunch."

There will still be a paper trail but a lot of the process will be more centralized and automated, and - we can hope - more secure."

"318","Rina R.","About that revamp - There's a lot of information about the new system (for 2020) online. If I understand correctly, the main points seem to be that all the registered voters get checked on a centralized system (not on the internet), so that each voter gets a customized ballot (for your specific council district, congress person, etc.) no matter where you vote. Instead of the ink-blob system, you'll input your answers on a screen and print out the ballot, which will be readable so you can check whether you marked it as you intended. It should be easier for disabled and visually impaired citizens, and those with limited English, to vote.

This will allow the Hollenbeck community to share only those crime and safety posts they choose to with Hollenbeck Senior Leads and team members.  (Nextdoor makes it clear this is at the community members' discretion, maintains privacy and is not a substitute for 911.)  

The Nextdoor feature, if you choose to activate it, allowing you to read crime & safety posts from community members is explained below and was taken directly from the Nextdoor website:

Again, thank you for your service and for reaching out with Nextdoor.
============================================
Receiving Crime & Safety Posts from Residents
The Forward to Police feature allows your residents to forward Crime & Safety posts and Urgent Alerts to local police staff on Nextdoor. This feature is only available to Law Enforcement agencies. 

How it works:

When a Nextdoor member creates an Urgent Alert or a post categorized as Crime & Safety, they will have the option of forwarding that message to their police department on Nextdoor. Click here to see what the feature looks like for your residents.

The forwarded message will appear in the inbox of a designated agency recipient. We will also send the recipient an email to notify them they have received a message.

How to activate the feature:

This feature is not enabled until you choose to turn it on. To activate Forward to Police, click on ""Forward to Police"" in the left-hand navigation bar. Using the dropdown, designate your staff members to receive the forwarded messages. If desired, you can choose a staff person for each of your service areas (this option is only available if you have staff assigned to specific service areas)."
"341","Sandra Pantoja","Thank you Captain Labrada, for your updates information regards to Nextdoor posting.  I thank you for your leadership and commitment to our community as well as to all officers who serve our communities as well.

Have a safe God bless day!"
"341","Sergeant, Hollenbeck Community Relations Alejandra Fiallos","@Thomas D, Thank you for the information.  I believe we rather you call us or email us, because this website isn't monitored 24/7 and at times we do not log on for a few days.  I know you understand it not being monitored, but other people may not, therefore we don't want them to think we are not replying and someone get upset or it leads to someone getting hurt.  I have had some people send me a cut and paste of information to my email.  For now I believe that would work best.  But continue to stay involved and send me the emails or calls."
"341","Tim Fromla","Thanks, Skipper. Also, is it possible to post the crime stats in Hillside Village or Hobk so that we can see what crimes and issues we face on Nextdoor?

Thank you"
"341","Mark Overstreet","Officer Fiallos and Capt. Labrada,    Having the LAPD provide info on this site is a great idea.  People do read what is posted."
"341","Ms. Claudia","Thank you so much Officer Fiallos. I will be forwarding you some information if you can please post on your media pages to promote. Also if you can keep us posted on crime in Lincoln Heights. Thank you for your hardwork and dedication. üôè"
"341","Sergeant, Hollenbeck Community Relations Alejandra Fiallos","Thank you all for your comments, suggestions, and interest in making your community safer!  About the crime updates, we will get on it!  This week has been busy with event planning since Sunday, by Thursday I should be good to post some crime tips!  I will aslo remind the SLOs, but they have also been busy attending some events and a few protests.  Again, please stay involved and THANK  YOU for your help!"
"341","Sylvie Cogranne","Well Captain Labrada, I hope you are seeing the message I just posted about shot guns, that end up being fireworks.
It was so loud I thought I was in my backyard. I jump from my chair and my heart was beating very fast. This is a huge problem in our community and I have personally called many times about one specific house using fireworks in the middle of the street  and nothing , absolutely nothing is being done.
This problem needs to be taking care of immediately. Thank you."
"343","Leonora V.","Will there be an event for evening hours?"
"343","Officer Elsa Gomez","Hello Leonora, Our hours are from 10am-3pm. It takes 10 minutes. Please stop by, if you can,"
"343","Sue Broomis","Do you need to sign up for this or is it first come first serve?"
"343","Leonora V.","So then No, you will not have an event for those who are not available during working hours?"
"343","Susan Monet","Will this event be held again this month ? Or is it open house style all the time ? It sounds like good info ."
"345","Elizabeth S.","When is the next CERT training?"
"345","Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT"," is where all the Los Angeles classes are posted.  

There is an Eagle Rock Class Thursday mornings starting May 3rd, 9am.

We don't have any evening classes scheduled right now in northeast LA.  We'll post on Nextdoor when the next one is scheduled."
"345","Tania H.","How old do you have to be to volunteer?"
"345","Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT","All ages are welcome but volunteers need to be able to follow directions and be okay with responders performing hands-on head-to-toe assessments under the supervision of our EMT coaches."
"345","Alicia S.","I will be a vic."
"345","Tania H.","I have a 7yr old boy and a 8yr old girl any advice on what I can sign them up for they want to come to this event"
"345","Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT","Tania, if you think they are mature enough to follow directions and are okay with having the hands-on head-to-toe assessment done to them (for kids that young, it's actually a toe-to-head assessment) and you'll volunteer with them then that should be fine.  We'll make sure you're with them on the same tarp."
"345","Tania H.","I am definitely volunteering with them."
"345","Andrei R.","Please, let me know if it happens in Eagle Rock. The site indicates down town. Where this even will happen?"
"345","Coordinator Battalion 2 CERT","This drill is being hosted in Lincoln Heights, about 10 min from Eagle Rock.
Out last drill in Feb was hosted in Eagle Rock.
We rotate our classes and drills around Northeast LA / Battalion 2."
"346","Angie Gomez","What is a good number to call to report people actively tagging?"
"346","Gillas Correa","What about when every single day , the same person will graffiti on the same public stair case, even thou I report to MyLA311 and it gets painted over everyday? Should we just keep playing this wasteful game of cat and mouse? I mean, EVERYDAY....."

"346","Alex B.","There‚Äôs graffiti on the sidewalks by where I live. I used the MyLA311 app to report it; someone came to see it and still left it like that."
"346","Frank          James Larez","People should not depend on the 311 app u can buy your own paint and start removing it yourselfs like i so once graffiti shows up in my neighborhood it comes down the same day or the next morning it u happen to drive into Rose Hills 90032 no graffiti in the city parks and the Rose Hills Courts Projects . but i don't call them projects . i call them public housing. Gangs call them PJS i am the number1 graffiti buster in my neighborhood i don't let taggers or gangmembers tag in this neighborhood graffiti brings gang shootings so or area is low in gang graffiti.."
"346","Carlos Morales Miramontes","Thank you! Been using the App and appreciate the quick graffiti removal program your team has."
"346","Gillas Correa","Alejandra, The Planing and Land Use Comity for Lincoln Heights neighborhood council had a member of the city works department and they explain to us, that once you call or use the MyLa311 app, it generates a track record and they are accountable for it, so if you created a service request and they did not follow thru with it, you can call again and make a formal complaint and whoever was supposed to do the cleaning/removal of the graffiti will be held accountable. It works. I had the same issue with a couple other places and after the complaint it gets escalated to a management level and they do take care of it."
"346","Annamarie Reza","I have used MyLa311app several times. It works!"
"346","Sergeant, Hollenbeck Community Relations Alejandra Fiallos","Thank you all for actively participating in your community!  I know its frustrating at times, but persistence helps!  Don't lose faith and keep it at!  I love the 311 app as well, but at times, they might not have all the supplies to take care of something, but again do not lose faith, they are all great workers assigned to the GAP unit.  A good number to call is 213-928-8223"

"353","Laine Ruva","Let your elderly friends and family know as well. They tend to get scared when someone says they‚Äôre sending someone to arrest you.
Last time I had some guy with a Nigerian accent tell me that he was coming to arrest me. I told him go right ahead, I‚Äôll be waiting lol and he called me bitch and hung up lol üòÇ"

"353","John Reyes","loosely related...my laptop started ""talking""...said ""you have a virus. call ____ right away!"" 

If that happens to you or your mom/dad/whomever, get someone reputable to check it out, but don't call the number!"

"353","Thomas Kim","TrueCaller and Hiya apps will help identify callers..."
"353","Natalie Hammons","Becareful the new scam is Apple! They say your Apple ID account has been hacked are there are unapproved charges. So they ask you to log on to your computer. They direct you to a website. You punch in a code and they hack your home computer. My friend was watching the money from her account go down to zero. She immediately unplugged her computer and modem. She called police. She lost 68,000$ in 10 minutes. The IRS and Apple will never call you. Just don't give info to anyone. Ask them to mail a letter to your home."

"355","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Yes, Thomas, you are referring to the 7 week CERT Basic Training coming up in Eagle Rock next month.  The ""Stop the Bleed"" training is different. It is just one session being offered during one of our monthly CERT Battalion meetings.  Please don't confuse the two."

"362","Melanie Nelson","I‚Äôm curious the answer to this. I just cringe and use the 311 app constantly."
"362","apache ing","Set up surveillance cameras and report the crime of illegal dumping.
Lets take pride in our beautiful community. Accept personal responsibility. How hard is it to call 311 rather than risk prosecution for illegal dumping."
"362","Helen Jew","There is an alley behind our house and people were dumping their junk.  For years, this was going on.  Our neighbor put up cameras on their property and some cameras are also facing the alley.  Since last year, we don't have people dumping anymore."
"362","Gillas Correa","We ""Prince St. Neighborhood watch"" have the same problem at one of our corners. We use the 311 app vigorously and because usually can take from 2 to 7 days for then to pick up, it sends the message that its a bumping ground. So I posted several home made signs in the post and on the ground asking people not to dump there, and also whenever there is a small dump, I would just pick it up and put it in the trash. Ultimately the camera idea should work"
"362","Rudy Marin","Removing trash from residential streets ( of taxpayers) isnt a priority for the City or the council office. The City has directed every dollar to helping the homeless."
"362","Gillas Correa","It may not be a top priority, but they do what they can. We the residents have to help too. Ideally by not trashing the city, but we can help clean up and we sure can make use of MyLa311, It works. The graffiti removal feature of the app for example get the removal done in less than 24 hours."
"362","Ari Bustamante","I‚Äôm all for maximizing resources for folks experiencing homelessness. I don‚Äôt think this is an issue of either/or. It‚Äôs apples and oranges. Suggestions need not rely on the city if we know this is a low priority regardless of why."
"362","Ari Bustamante","As much as possible, i‚Äôd love creative suggestions that don‚Äôt involve increase in law enforcement presence/criminalization in our neighborhoods"
"362","Gillas Correa","I agree with you Tonya, it sucks to clean up after people. I do it to combat the attitude of; ‚ÄúIts already dirty, a little more wont matter.‚Äù"
"362","Melanie Nelson","I understand that some residents prefer the trash and debris in the street/parkways, as being clean is a sign of gentrification and therefore not desirable."
"362","Cecilia Zavala","@ari.. i have the same problem... neighbors keep dumping junk outside their house and I immediately use my 311 app and request pick up. But i think the more i do this the more they dump trash because they figure its a dumping ground.- I as a property owner pisses me off because it devalues  my house and the neighborhood.. maybe thats what they want .. I mean we already have skid row moving in the 5 lots. Sorry to those who get offended but i dont give a sh*t ‚Äî This is why I welcome gentrification."

"365","Olivia Biera","did you add worms? soil or manure? I have a large pile that i have to turn every so often but im getting good results."
"365","Steven Kenny","I don't know if I qualify as a compost expert but what I did was have 2 compost bins that I rotate throughout the year. When one is full I put it aside and don't add anything new. That way the stuff has a chance to break down without being fed new material. The second bin gets the new stuff, and when it's full the first bin gets emptied in the garden. It took at least 6 months the first time I tried, but after not being fed new material and being let to decompose for months it becomes a rich black/brown slop that surprisingly does not smell too bad."
"365","Dongyi W.","It sounds like you're not giving enough air to the compost, it has too much nitrogen (green materials, food scraps, coffee, manure) and needs more carbon (dried leaves, shredded paper, cardboard, napkins, etc). If it smells dank it might also be a sign that it's too wet, so the browns/carbon would help. Also, remember to turn your compost! It's an aerobic composting, unlike worm composting, and needs air. Turning it allows air to get to the center of the pile."
"365","Alene Shaibi","I am not an expert but I think some people might like to handle their composting this pleasant, more simple way.  I have been growing in my small box garden in my back patio for years.  Burying food scraps in the boxes, it was somewhat unpleasant to later dig around and still have pieces that hadn't composted.  I now keep an old blender under my sink to put all my raw food scraps in.  When it is full, I add water, blend and then bury it in an available growing box.  Egg shells work well, too.  Within a short time I can stir and mix the soil, put a small layer of purchased organic soil and plant my seeds."
"365","Robert LeJeune","Composting needs sunshine too ( for the heat)"
"365","Alene Shaibi","The boxes are in the sunshine, I pour it thinly on the surface and use a shovel of soil from another box to cover it.   Seems to work.  Thanks for the reminder, Robert."

I saw red and started yelling ‚ÄúTHIS IS NOT YPUR PERSONAL GARBAGE CAN! Come back and pick your sh*t up and throw it away on your own lawn!!!‚Äù. Needless to say it didn‚Äôt sit well with them and they stopped their car and started coming at me so I ran as fast as I could and they finally gave up the chase. Yes, stupid (I was only in my 20‚Äôs), but I could not help it. I was enraged. I probably would have done the same if I had seen this lady do this."

We are surrounded by bordering cities and unfortunately many people that think its not a big deal to take someones car so they can use it! Either they work or live/visit in the neighborhood.  We are asking for prints from all the vehicles!

"381","Sergeant, Hollenbeck Community Relations Alejandra Fiallos","Many different areas, but if you see a lot of graffiti, it usually means there is an active gang in the area and they are claiming their area by writing things they only understand."
"381","Sergeant, Hollenbeck Community Relations Alejandra Fiallos","Think about it like this when it comes to lights, if you turn on your living room light to look outside, you just lighted up yourself, They see you first.  You can be in the dark living room and look outside with your porch lights and usually you will see them first!"
"381","Rose M.","I think leaving the porch light on is easier for neighbors to see if  someone is trying to get into your backyard or car.

After I took the class I purchased a Stop the Bleed Kit which I kept in my car.  I was on my way home from dropping off my son when I drove by an accident. I noticed there was a man on the ground and a pool of blood around his leg.  I pulled over to see if the people already helping needed any assistance. They were trying to stop the bleeding without success. I had a tourniquet in my kit that I applied and we were able to get the bleeding under control while we waited for the Fire Department to arrive. I highly recommend taking the class if you have the opportunity. I also have taken the CERT course and the new AED/CPR class which was also very informative."

Looking forward to sharing the info with my school, church, neighbors and friends."
"382","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Jeff, & Marita,  I'm glad you found the training useful.

She looked at the monitor and saw a car parked right next to my Prius.  She went out to the porch, cell phone in hand and asked if she could help them. An Asian man in his mid to late 20's and a young girl wearing a hoodie and small backpack were squatting behind my car. The guy looked back at my sister, said ""Sorry about that"", they turned in a hurry, got in their car and left. The car looked like a dark Nissan or Toyota, with tinted windows. Be on the lookout! They pull up right next to the car to jump in quickly."

"400","Oscar Bustos","My wife and I would definitely be interested in this."
"400","Beth Shapiro","Hi Kimberly, This sounds awesome, we love brunch and would love a place to go to in Lincoln Heights. 

1. Hours sound good to me
2. I think a location on Broadway would be great

Keep us posted if it becomes a reality! Good luck!"
"400","Linda Truong","This is a fabulous idea and I‚Äôd definitely support this. Hours are good and a location on Broadway or Pasadena would be great."
"400","Amanda McCann","Broadway location would be amazing! I bet you could get away with 10-2"
"400","Jenni Xx","If you're wondering if there's a demand, go to Nick's on Spring any weekend day. They usually have a wait from 8:30 am until 1 or 2 pm."
"400","Susan S.","Sounds great.  I like the Pasadena near 5 corners."
"400","Teresa barrios","Sounds like a great idea! I know what you mean about driving to highland park! I live in Lincoln heights so that would be great! On broadway my vote"
"400","Sue Andersen","definitely would be great. need a spot that has parking available nearby I'll be waiting for the opening"
"400","Eric Maxwell","?You could advertrise it onsomething like this platform:

"400","Eric Maxwell","(And i'm totally own for something like this)"
"400","javier angulo","My partner and I are always looking for brunch spots near us, but are forced to go out of the neighborhood because of no options. What about taking over Betty's Diner on Broadway? We brunch Sundays at about 11-2pm. Anywhere in LHs works for us. Ive also seen several spaces along Pasadena that could host."
"400","Gwendolyn Young","Sounds like a good idea. Especially if there is a variety of fresh food, wild fish and interesting preparations. Not the same old thing 
We would support"
"400","Aaron Ray","Way into it! Those hours are perfect. We'll be there. :)"
"400","Janne Larsen","Sounds great! I‚Äôd come! I like the Pasadena 5 corners or broadway. I‚Äôm into 8 or 9-2. Locally sourced veggies and meats would be ü§©"
"400","Sandra Switzer","Sounds great"
"400","Vanessa Bonet","Love this! I am in full support! Hours seem good to me."
"400","Maria Lu","Love your idea and hope it comes about sooner than later. Including Vegan options that would be the bomb. I'd come 8-2 or 8-3 sounds better. Any location as long as there is decent parking around. You can have a great place but if the parking is awfull that will turn people off."
"400","John Reyes","I wouldn't promote the ""secret house"" option on Nextdoor, if you know what I mean"
"400","Anna Sanchez","Love your idea and hope it comes to fruition. 9 to 2 sound like reasonable brunch hours. Vegetarian and vegan options are a great idea. Would be lovely to have an area with access to an outdoor patio or garden for alfresco dining. I think your biggest challenge is finding a place that accessible but with street parking available. Good luck!"
"400","Tiffany Srisook","Love the idea and totally in support. The hours sound right to me!"
"400","Sue Andersen","tonya, please enlighten us of these many brunch spots already here. then your post would be helpful."
"400","Jenni Xx","Parking is not important. Everybody needs to get out and walk instead of driving a half-mile or mile each way to food."
"400","Sue Andersen","Some people are not able to walk a half-mile, or maybe even a block, but they still enjoy going out for brunch"
"400","Jenni Xx","Yes, Sue, we know not everybody CAN walk, but upwards of 90% can. And them what can't can take an Uber or something. Adding a parking requirement to this only drives the prices up. 

I don't want to pay for a place to put anybody's car, or pay for their driving habit. Your parking, IMO, is your problem."
"400","Nick Ma","Yes to more brunch spots!"
"400","Sue Andersen","thank you Jenni for your compassionate and caring attitude"
"400","Andy Simonson","Would be cool to have a brunch pop up in one of the amazing yards up the hills with beautiful brunch views around here sometime"
"400","Tiffany Srisook","Andy, that's actually a real cool idea"
"400","Kelly McDonald","I agree that if the purpose is to provide Lincoln Heights residents with food in Lincoln Heights, then parking shouldn‚Äôt be a factor. I‚Äôll walk from Montecito Heights if there‚Äôs a vegan option!"
"400","Betti Rosmar","Totally interested with good vegan options (and by good I don't mean a burrito without cheese). I could get other vegans to come also."
"400","Cecilia Zavala","Only good spots to eat near me in Lincoln Heights is 

-El Huarachito who offer no beer or mimosas but good food.

-Barbaras in the Arts Lofts  is ok food & serve good beer....

-La Abeja which is a hole in the wall ..has good food but no beer ..

-B Twenty Four ... I haven‚Äôt tried it yet .. my husband picked up coffee from there and was pretty good... coming from a coffee snob who always goes to Demitasse only lol .. 

other than that ..I usually find myself driving towards Highland Park or DTLA.. wish there wer more spots in Lincoln Heights."
"400","Maria Ortiz","My vote is a Yes !"
"400","Yolanda Mendo","I would support this! What about 7Mares on N. broadway? They have some parking but there‚Äôs an adjacent lot with additional spaces."
"400","Rena Santoro","This place I believe is for rent... University Hills is across the street...close to USC...Hillside Village...etc."
"400","Callie Humphrey","Yes! Yes! I too work in the industry and would love to support a local pop up. I‚Äôm personally more of an 11-4p brunch go-er, but that‚Äôs because I work late hours bartending. :)"
"400","Michael Gunn","Yes yes!"
"400","Kimberly Jordan","Wow! This has been super inspiring! Glad to know there are people who would be into this idea. I‚Äôm going to start making plans for this!  I will definitely keep everyone updated on the progress! Thank you so much for your feedback everyone!"
"400","Christine Hazlet","YES PLEASE. This sounds super fun and the 5 points could use some more options"
"400","Armida Marrufo","Nice, especially the Vegetarian option. Make it Happenüí™üèº"
"400","Armida Marrufo","Actually, I just thought of maybe around the Main Street area. USC is around the corner- student nurses, residents, doctors, etc. And it can enlighten/brighten Main St. just like Broadway. Maybe offer a discount with USC ID. Just my 2 cents."
"400","Silver Gutierrez","Well considering Betty's Diner just closed due to her rent being raised to $6,000 a month and not being able to afford it because all her food was so reasonably priced (omelets were $6)that spot is now open. (Thanks gentrification!)"
"400","Paloma Delosangeles","Nooooo...Betty's Diner is my mom & son's favorite spot! That's ridiculous! I was just thinking yesterday about what strategies we as a community can take to protect existing businesses...not my area of expertise but, damn, there are some gems that I personally would like to make sure stay in business and affordable! El Hurarachito, the old barber shop and shoe repair...I know there are so many others..."
"400","Mary Donald","Love this idea!  Always like having a choice of where to eat and like fresh, healthy choices!"
"400","Tj McCall","Where is there a ‚Äúbrunch‚Äù spot in highland park please....."
"400","Glen Ordinario","Yes! Even better with vegan options and alcohol! üëç"
"400","Rena Santoro","Takes a village!!üòÅ 
And there u have it!!üòâ"
"400","Sara Ortiz","What a great idea! My husband and I love brunch and are always looking for brunch places around the area. We love a good brunch place, with great ambiance, a patio, and the option for bottomless mimosas. A house or on Broadway would be ideal! The hours are perfect too! I prefer Sunday but also go on Saturdays! Go for it! I think you would be very successful at it. We need a break from Barbix, Bon Vivant, etc. üòâ"
"400","Nix Calvert","This sounds amazing!"
"400","Paul Visconti","For sure interested! 9 to 3 sounds good. Location best on broadway but parking most important! Good luck keep us posted. Cheers !"
"400","Linda Torn","Great idea!  Parking‚Äôs important and dog friendly would be great."
"400","Julie Zemel","It sounds like you haven‚Äôt lived here long? It‚Äôs Pasadena Ave and 5 points. More restaurants are always good I don‚Äôt always want a Mexican breakfast and am recently vegan so more options would be swell."
"400","Tomika Bruen","Yes, please! My husband and I live in Lincoln Heights and totally support your plan. As soon as we come up with some ideas, we'll post them."
"400","Dario Sanmiguel","I know the director at the Senior Center on Workman. And they have a kitchen and parking."
"400","Andrew McQuinn","Yes. We definitely need a brunch spot in the Heights on the weekends!"

"406","John o.","Why do these people get paid over $130K per year?  They don't actually work. They have no background or experience in Public Works. They have meetings but don't do anything. Oh well. This has been a political prize position for a long time. I guess we should be happy they have meetings. What a waste."
"406","Justin W.","My only gripe with street lighting is all the studies they've done on the new LED lights they're installing being too blue (5000k) and causing problems with our circadian rhythm.

"
"406","Scott W.","I love LED‚Äôs but also Hate the 5000+k very blue/white. Something more along 3500k to 3800k is just as bright and much easier on the eyes."
"406","Marsha B.","My concern  is the streets and sidewalks.  Other cities, gardena, culver city, Hawthorne  streets and sidewalks look good and Los Angeles streets and sidewalks are horrible.  Awhile back I heard on the news the major spent 400 millions dollars to replace a cross over bridge on 5  street, or in that general area.  I have been upset about this.  We the people of Los Angeles  are the last on the totem pole,  but our tax dollars are used for projects that doesn't bring anything to our communities.   I am not voting for any of our so called representstatives  any more.  We vote the same people in every election and they don't  do anything for us.  NO  MORE"
"406","JUNE J.","I sure wish they would fix 90th street at Rayford! The trees have torn that street up for years and I know there have been a few alignments messed up from going over it."
"406","Margaret P.","Florence/Western going west to Crenshaw, the trees need cutting/trimming, the side walks are in bad condition, They repaired the street in Westchester and Beverly Hills, but not in our neighborhoods.  So to our representatives, what is the problem with getting the sidewalks repaired."
"406","Caitlin R.","Seems like we could make do with street cleaning every other week, and use the money saved on things we desperately need like just basic maintenance of sidewalks, skirting palm trees that are dropping huge chunks of dead leaves, potholes, etc"
"406","Marvina M.","Must be election season. Well the trees on my street are due for a trim/cut. The magnolia's are blocking sun and streetlights at night making it the perfect place for people to sit in cars and eat and smoke then leave trash in the streets. The city trimmed the trees on 11th a couple of weeks ago now they need to hit all the streets between 11th and Arlington."
"406","Nancy S.","Really the only way to get issues addressed is via CM Ryu's office--AND showing up at this (and other) meetings to voice your needs. Posting them here doesn't resolve them."
"406","Julie H.","@Caitlin R - Good idea, but if they switched the street cleaning to every other week they'd lose out on the revenue of so many tickets, which is the main reason they do it anyway."
"406","Chris H.","Is this meeting for CD 10 only?"
"406","james m.","WHAT ABOUT THE STENCH IN THE VICINITY OF VICTORY BLVD. AND HASKELL AVE."
"406","Kelly D.","Can they conduct a meeting in the valley, rather than downtown? Or in addition to that meeting? I appreciate that they‚Äôre reaching out, but by not providing a place to meet that is reasonably within a 45 minute drive after someone gets off work, it‚Äôs not effective."
"406","Tony W.","Hi James M. and Kelly D. - This Public Works meeting is in Council President Herb Wesson's District Office on Western Avenue. It is just North of Washington Boulevard and the 10 Freeway (park in the rear, off the little street to the West). Although I think the meeting is designed for Herb's downtown Council District 10, it clearly got posted in lots of other areas, including some in the Valley. Everyone will be welcome at this meeting if you want to make the drive. If you'd like to have a similar meeting in the Valley, call or email the staff of Councilwoman Nury Martinez (or whoever is your Councilmember) and let them know."

We could not find him at all after he ran off, although three of us adults looked. It was dark and he just faded into the night. The German shepherd stayed around us, but the little one took off and I haven‚Äôt seen it again. I DON‚ÄôT think it‚Äôs the same dog as the one pictured above. It had black/grey curly/shaggy fur and maybe weighed 15lbs approximately.  I will post again if we see it again!"

"420","Cecilia Zavala","It's housing for people who don't currently have homes and who are low-income, so not sure how you could say you support low-income housing but not this. Even better, it's housing that will provide free services to the residents to help them stabilize their lives."
"420","Vanessa Luna","I support hardworking people who are low of income  and need housing .....i do not support housing for Skid row drug addicts. Completely different scenario. Problem here is that we don‚Äôt know exactly whats goin on or what are Cedillos plans."
"420","Cecilia Zavala","Pasadena has afforable housing, but it's not homeless housing. And yes homeless housing brings down property value.

Who in their right mind would want to have homeless drug addicts, mentally ill roaming in their community as this would have a negative impact on small communities and cities.

 what the city of Los Angeles is doing is relocating the HOMELESS into other areas of the city and redeloping the skid row area into fancy areas like the Art district with lofts and high rise  building.sThe city needs to relocate them in order to attract  developers..‚ÄîWho in their right mind would want a senior living in building with the mentality I'll, and substance abusers.Senior building do not bring down property value, but that building has to be for seniors only for there safety, and that of the community.

Use that money form Measure HHH to build in skid row, and watch that 1.2 billion turn into a shit hole area. CRIME infested, and a health hazard with hepatitis, t.b. etc due to unsanitary conditions."
"420","Cecilia Zavala","HHH-funded apartments are not typical developments. They will come with services for residents and are restricted by tons of regulatory agencies for years, which ensures that the building will be much better managed than some random apartment building. Besides, Skid Row is not the only place where people who don't have housing live. There are plenty of people living on the streets in all areas of the County, including NE LA. Rather than them ""roaming"" about, wouldn't you rather they be given affordable homes and support to help them get back on their feet? You talk about letting Skid Row become crime infested and a health hazard--those conditions exist already, so how would you solve them?

Your reply also assumes that people without housing don't work. I  don't want to get into respectability politics and who deserves housing, but the assertion that no homeless people work is wrong."
"420","Vanessa Luna","Why is it thats they are not doing these HHH housing in Palos Verdes? Beverly Hills? Because they dont want their cities to look like a shit hole .. thats why .."
"420","Cecilia Zavala","Umm...HHH is a City of LA measure and neither of those places is part of the City. Disappointing that you don‚Äôt respond in a manner conducive to actual discussion. There‚Äôs no facts, just a lot of incendiary opinions and generous use of the word ‚Äúshithole.‚Äù"
"420","Vanessa Luna","Have you ever even seen a development of the the type that will be built with HHH money? I can assure you these are not ‚Äúshithole‚Äù apartments."
"420","Vanessa Luna","Ok if you say so ..I guess i have to cross my fingers because Cedillo is not being transparent about what‚Äôs really going on.."
"420","Cecilia Zavala","With the rate our rent is skyrocketting in Lincoln Heights I might end up in one of those Low Income apartments myself..."
"420","Silver Gutierrez","Great conversation! I know that our area has had some bad experiences with 'projects' in the past and that Cedillo's office has been, er, less than transparent. As a homeowner here for the long term, concerned about safety and quality of life for all and involved in my neighborhood, I will stand with everyone to demand that incoming developments have an overall positive impact. 

It's also really important that we all know what we are talking about. In fact, all City Council Districts have made commitments to construct Supportive Housing and United Way is working with communities to help ensure that people's concerns are heard and addressed.

I hope the Pitbulls will also find homes but as we all know, it takes a LOT longer to find a home for them. If they are chipped or tagged and Animal Control picks them up, or if they try to claim their dogs, it will cost them $$143 EACH to get them out. Then they will be chipped and fixed. Unless A/C deems them neglected,  they will be given a hefty fine. Why do people have dogs if they treat them so badly? I hope these dogs find new homes SOON."

"441","Carrie Cuestas","I assume the blinking yellow is kind of like a yield, 'you can go, but be aware you might need to stop and let someone through' kind of deal. Because it's so late there's not much point in keeping the green/yellow/red and making people wait unnecessarily if no one is coming. If that's the case though, it would be nice if the city would let people know. I've heard a lot of questions about it and no one has had a clear answer."
"441","Alan Reyes","Yup, the traffic lights on Broadway turn blinking yellow to keep the traffic flowing up/down Broadway late at night. Since crossing traffic is  sporadic, it gets red/blinking red lights; this means that the traffic down Broadway has the right of way and the cross traffic must stop, and yield until it is clear. When the intersection detects crossing traffic, it will turn the Broadway light solid red and the crossing light green to let traffic across Broadway. Hope that helps!"

If you want to do something useful and ask them to put a bridge from Broadway to the new park, that'd be great, but this petition is just NIMBY-ism using all the traditional tools of the trade, including fear-mongering, hyperbolic rhetoric and of course, inaccurate facts. 

The fact is that ""affordable housing"" already exists, it's just being filled by people who could afford more, but there nowhere for them to go. It's also a fact that insisting that developers build projects that can't be built profitably due to parking and AHU's hurts everybody."
"451","Gabby Rayvan","yes, affordable housing exists, definitely a fact. All the other points aren't facts. if you know how low income housing works, you would know that all your information gets looked into. it's almost impossible to get into affordable housing if you can afford more. there are long wait lists of people who are desperate to get into housing and some are even waiting years just to get called. your ""facts"" are not supported by anything other than you saying their ""facts."" look up homeless rates in Los angeles and information posted by the Los angeles mission. what's truly selfish is ignoring that people are suffering and we keep turning our back on them by creating fancy housing that only caters for the wealthy"
"451","David Poffenberger","Gabby, Jenni is referring to market rate affordable housing which no longer exists because of nimbys and petitions like the one in the original post. There is nothing ""fancy"" about this proposed project. Every amenity associated with it is to help it sell at a price point that will recoup the development and construction costs. If you truly wanted cheaper housing you would be pushing to relieve parking requirements and build more."

"462","Yvonne ORallo","The DMV requires it when your car is declared a salvage. The car is a 2005 Toyota Corolla with 42,000 miles. Unfortunately, the value was less than what it would've cost my insurance to fix it so they declared it salvage.  I kept the car, shopped around and found a body shop that fixed it for half the price the body shop my insurance sent me to quoted since the damage was to the door and there was no damage to the engine. So I need this ""certificate"" to get my registration sticker.  But the DMV doesn't tell you this. I waited for the registration sticker after mailing in a check on 11/20, cashed on 12/15, no sticker so I called and they let me know.  It would've helped if they sent the info with the registration renewal."

It would've been nice if the DMV sent the info with the registration renewal instead of cashing the check and making you wonder if the sticker got lost or stolen in the mail. But I guess these things you are supposed to magically know.  Luckily when I called I got someone very helpful and she mailed out a packet to me unbeknownst to me it showed up 2 days after our conversation, so I know the rep sent it.  It doesn't seem too difficult but I figured it would be best to go to someone that is recommended that a random brake and light inspection place. From what I've read on yelp, it sounds like some places like to rip people off. Though I can't imagine our car would have any issues with the brakes or lights since it only has 42,000 miles and it's a Toyota. But I'd rather avoid sketchy places.

Councilman Cedillo has decided to develop 5 parking lots in LH (all about 1/4 mile from each other on Broadway) without any prior community outreach. The developer has been chosen and a deal was made behind closed doors, again, without any community input. The method Councilman Cedillo went around doing so (such as giving less than 24 hour notice before the city council voted to develop the lots) is extremely sketchy and questionable. 

The community was strongly opposed to this motion at our last meeting.

"472","Martin GOMEZ","We are expecting Mr. Cedillo in person at our next council meeting FEB 15 2018 6 PM. At the LINCOLN HEIGHTS SENIOR CENTER. There are many holes in his explanation & I am looking forward to addressing them IN PERSON and in front of the PEOPLE. Mr. Cedillo has the reputation of blindsiding and truth bending. We must confront this head on and not be complacent in this matter. Please attend the neighborhood council meeting. Bring your questions and stay vigilant."
"472","Luis Gonzalez","Martin, is there anyway you can make flyers to pass around the neighborhood of El Sereno and Hillside Village before this date comes upon us. Thanks, Luis"
"473","Heather D.","Greetings. I‚Äôm in the process of purchasing a historic home in Leimert Park. It has an extra bedroom and bath and I would be happy to rent it out, if he is interested"

"481","Maria Arias","I‚Äôll be calling on Monday to get his ID number to check up on him."
"481","Jess Sean","Shelter is the best way for his family to find him! I took the dog I found to the shelter a few months ago- i went back the day he was available and brought him home :) was an unexpected addition to the family."
"481","Maria Arias","Thank you üôè is good to know. I‚Äôm feeling guilty for leaving over there."
"481","Mitzi Spallas","Don‚Äôt worry about dogs like this at the shelter. Especially if they are friendly. They will get adopted IMMEDIATELY. (We call them Disney dogs. Haha). Many times there‚Äôre are so many adopters that they have an auction and the dog goes to the highest bidder. I only worry about Pitbulls and senior dogs. And lately...too many Huskies!"

"482","Damita C.","Thx for posting. So can your CERT certification via webinar now?"
"482","Carolyn B.","Damita, 
No, the Webinar was for discussion of recent disasters only. It is not CERT training where you get certified."

"493","Erica Silverman","Please report coyote sightings to the LA Urban Coyote Project. They are studying our coyote population.

"
"493","Ruxby Clemente","How fascinating!! I definitely will inform them. There just seems to be so many, in our yards that I wonder what is going on. Thank you!"
"493","Diea Anszara","I see one fairly often on sierra around Borel when I leave before 5:30amish"
"493","Yvonne ORallo","Please consider bringing any pets inside when the sun sets.  

Increased sightings is a good sign.  What would not be a good sign is them interacting and getting confortable around people. But an increase in population is never a bad thing."
"493","Lenora You","There is a beautiful male (assuming based on size) that occasionally comes around Sierra and Roberta. This coyote walks through like a boss! From a distance one could mistake him for a wolf. He is really that big and nothing phases him."
"493","Ruxby Clemente","I agree these poor coyotes are at no fault that they are looking for food but if your pets are inside at night, hopefully it will prevent added conflicts between people and wildlife."
"493","C. L. Mills","@Erica Silverman - recently posted a morning siting to the LA Urban Coyote Project - thanks again for sharing that link!"
"496","Tom M.","How ironic. How about I report the state of California for the blatant mismanagement and price gouging of our tax dollars."
"496","Victoria K.","Can we report the DWP?"
"496","Debby M.","I second that one."
"496","jimmy b.","how about fuel prices"
"496","Lynzee B.","And the City Trash collection companies for condos and apartments."
"496","Karey S.","You are kidding me? The city is the standard of price gouging! We pay the HIGHEST taxes in the nation and we are ‚Äúurged‚Äù to report offenders? Ok I‚Äôm in. I report the city. They are price gouging!!!! The audacity is outrageous!"
"496","Cheryl B.","I agree with all"
"496","Colleen A.","Me too!!!  That is hilarious.  ( not really )"
"496","Robert V.","does anyone know how they came up with 10 percent? i guess i can googled it but you guys are a smart bunch."
"496","Bo H.","Called the number.  Only a recording.  Several options but absolutely none of them mention price gouging.  I was cancelled by my insurance co. & now can't get any insurance company to right a policy.  They all say there's a moratorium for my zip code.  Insurance industry...another corrupt, greedy & price gouging industry."
"496","Sue D.","AG Becerra is more concerned about his Illegal voter base than he is taxpaying citizens.   Why are we worrying about being a sanctuary when we cant even go a block on our roads they are in such disrepair?  WAIT Til your Registration fees are due!!!  DOUBLED and TRIPPLED Lisc fees!!"
"496","Kimberly M.","I had that happen on a house, but never was able to get insurance in the first place. They charged me for a policy via my mortgage company for $3600 a year. About 6 months later, I found a company to cover that house for $1400 a year. It was dozens of calls to find coverage though."
"496","Bill V.","While this may be illegal, for some it may be the only way one can get services in an emergency before the ""goods"" run out. Empty shelves is what one can expect.  Price gouging is a term applied to situations like the current mud slides and to possible earthquake situations. What it means is that goods simply will not be available to those most in need- as it is not worth the hassle of going to an area that has experienced an event, unless it is done for charity. This of course goes against the buyer/seller principle long established thousands of years ago.  The debate as to the wisdom of such laws goes on, but the State and the legislature has the power to pass such laws."
"496","Susan T.","What about grocery stores price gouging us on food. It's getting the point where we can barely afford to eat anymore."
"496","Shirley E.","I have also been dropped from my homeowners insurance due to living within 1/2 mile of brush area.  Farmers Insurance is the only one who will insure me IF I also purchase a California Fair Plan for fire as well. Together costing me more than 4 X's what my current insurance is.  I have until Feb. 10 to find a new carrier.  Any ideas?"

"503","Jessica G.","So far $120! üòá I just posted again so that it doesn't end up getting in the abyss of posts and forgotten about"
"503","Maria Gomez","I wish I could donate more... Praying for a quick recovery. I was so happy you found him :)  now is the time to help out.:)"
"503","Jessica G.","Thank you Maria, for your donation and well wishes. Anything helps!!!"
"503","Sylvie Cogranne","I beg all my friends to get insurance for their pet. $ 16 a month with ASPCA they paid a surgery for my dog $ 2000. They are great. And if you have any doubt ASPCA does amazing work at saving animals everyday. So if you never use the insurance, you will be donating to a good cause. Win win situation."
"503","Jessica G.","Yea too late for insurance right now though. If he pulls thru this, I will no doubt get him insurance because he's definitely going to have long term medical issues from this horrific accident."
"503","Maria Gomez","Hi Jessica,

I was wondering ,does this post also go out to nearby  neighbors? Cowboys situation is so sad .The neighbors are so kind this outcome surprises meüêæüêæblessings"
"503","Jessica G.","Mmm well I hope it is reaching our neighbors and the people on the outskirts of our neighborhood too- when I posted this I clicked the option where it would no only include our neighbor with only like 300 something people in it but I clicked the one that includes more people- to get the most exposure. Someone actually reported me to the NextDoor App people for posting ""too much"". They sent me an email saying someone had reported me for ""over posting"". I'm like!!!! Wow how sad! I'm just trying to get the most exposure for him - cuz I was not only posting in the ""Lost and Found"" sections on this app but also on the other sections like ""General"" and ""Recommendations"" just so that if people clicked on those options they wouldn't miss seeing my post about Cowboy you know? That's all I was trying to do. I didn't think anyone would REPORT me for doing that. I was sad. I've never had a problem posting stuff like that on Craigslist in all different categories you know? They've never come at me like that trying to make me take down my ""excessive posts"" ü§ß"
"503","Jessica G.","To the person who Reported me- all I'm trying to do is give the very best opportunity for my Emotional Support Animal to get better as soon as possible by getting his campaign the most exposure for the most help so that I can have him back in my home where he belongs! Please, I beg that you learn some compassion and understanding this year"
"503","Jessica G.","Plus I've seen other people do it! I've seen plenty of the owners of the other animals that are still lost post more than once. And it's because they don't want their pet to be forgotten about! And they don't want their pets post to get pushed down the list where no one can see them cuz not everyone scrolls down that far all the time. So I really don't understand what the huge deal was about my posts üò£"
"503","Mitzi Spallas","I‚Äôm sorry that someone reported you Jessica. Some people have no idea how much our pets mean to us. My dog is EVERYTHING to me, as I know Cowboy is to you. I feel bad that Cowboy is in such a dire situation and you are only trying to get him help. I hope you have an Instagram and Facebook page and that your friends on those will help you. I see this happen all of the time on Facebook-People...strangers...rally around a dog that needs help. Sometimes asking for help is the only option people have short of giving up their pet because they can‚Äôt afford the unexpected high vet bills, and that is one of the saddest things I‚Äôve ever witnessed.  I‚Äôve had some really really kind and generous people help me on here when I‚Äôve rescued a dog and needed help so I always try to help others when I can to return the kindness.
I hope your friends, neighbors, and strangers come through and give up their Starbucks for the day and give the money to you instead. Good luck Jessica, to you and Cowboy. I‚Äôll hit up my Facebook friends again."
"503","Maria Lu","Jessica, unfortunately there are all types and  if they didn't want to receive your post, I would think there is a way to not follow it...."

"505","Vanessa Bonet","I‚Äôm sorry your dog was hurt, but glad to hear you have him back. I donated a little $$ to your gofundme. I hope you receive enough to help rehabilitate him."

"505","fanny gallegos","Have you tried contacting the amanda fundation or lucy pet fundation sometimes they help.I will donate something and good luck keep your head up! I will pray for Cowboy recovery."
"505","Jessica G.","Thank you for your donation! I greatly appreciate it. No I have not heard of either of those foundations but I will look them up. Thank you for the suggestions!"

"505","jake thesnake","Wouldn't it better if it won't heal by itself, instead of having the pet hospitalized (which is expensive  per day) maybe think what's best for the pet. If he's a registered E.S.A. maybe there's programs like humane society or the Amanda foundation yes there is a waiting list I think but there's help out there just have to look, or pts"
"505","Jessica G.","Thanks jake. I am thinking of what is best for my beloved Cowboy. What is pts?"
"505","fanny gallegos","I received news that cowboy is recovering, I am keeping him in my prayers and to all of our neighbors that can help every dollar please lets help our neighbor . Thank you"
"505","Jessica G.","Thank you fanny. Yes, Cowboy's appetite is better- he's eating and drinking! ü§ó which I'm super happy about because he's so so sickly skinny right now :( and they said today he was able to poop on his own without help of an enema! So this is all progress! As long as he isn't declining I'm ecstatic! Did you call to check in on him today?"
"505","fanny gallegos","I guess the go fund me account send me a status. I am so happy to hear that from the bottom of my heart and he looks adorable in the picture with the birthday hat it is so sad to see him in the current picture but with gods help he will wear that birthday hat again! Stay strong and god bless!"

"511","Jessica G.","Yes checked the shelter all day yesterday. No luck. And I'm pretty sure they are closed today :/ but I'll still check their website every 2 hours. Thank you both!!!!!"
"511","Angelica Garza","I am so sorry to hear this. I would recommend giving leaflets to the people who live on Griffin as well. You can't put leaflets in mailboxes, so maybe on their doors. I would even knock on some doors and try to talk with people who live where the dog was last seen. (My dog went missing once and it turned out my neighbor across the street had my dog.)"
"511","Angelica Garza","Oh, what is the dog's name? Is he chipped? Did he or she have a collar?"
"511","Jessica G.","Thanks. I did knock on all doors and only 2 people saw him. They couldn't capture him though. He's too fast. I'll be making flyers tomorrow since all is closed today. I've posted on FB and Craig's List and everything else imaginable. I just want him back so badly I can't stop crying!"
"511","Angelica Garza","I am so sorry you're going through this. I know it hurts a lot. But I believe he is going to turn up. He is so cute, I bet someone has him."
"511","Linda Torn","I hope your dog comes back. Good luck."
"511","Mitzi Spallas","I‚Äôm so sad for you!! I pray he is safe with someone and they will see your posts and flyers and return him. Keep your chin up and your hopes high."

"511","mike antonelli","was he micro chipped? have you checked the north central animal shelter?"
"511","Jessica G.","Not chipped. Yes I've been checking there. No luck yet."
"511","Mayra Solis","Saw this post about a found dog on Facebook. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the same dog but thought I would share, just in case."
"511","Jessica G.","Thank u for your help. But No, unfortunately that isn't my dog :( it is definitely a salt and pepper schnauzer puppy tho! üò≠ so adorable. Someone must be equally as devastated as I am!"
"511","Jessica G.","***UPDATE*** 
Cowboy has been FOUND! I reunited with him earlier today! After almost 2 whole weeks of being missing! He's in pretty bad shape, lost a lot of weight, got hit my a car and was attacked by an animal- but nothing life threatening! Taking him to the vet in the morning to get him all fixed up! Thanks to everyone who was on the lookout!"
"511","Mitzi Spallas","Oh my gosh!!!!! You found him!!!! That is amazing!!! Good way to start the New Year!!! I‚Äôm so very happy for you. I agree-get him chipped, get him a collar with your name and phone number on it. Poor little guy must be so happy to be home. I‚Äôm glad everything worked out!! üëèüèºüòÅüê∂üêæ"
"511","Cynthia Jaykay","Yay!  Please give him a hug from my family!"
"511","mike antonelli","i recommend gateway animal hospital on los feliz blvd, dr. villacana.
also, a big hallelujah from one dog owner to another that you found him...you are soooo lucky:)"
"511","Maria Lu","Thanks for the update"
"511","Angelica Garza","Congratulations! I‚Äôm so happy to hear you were reunited. How did you track him down?"
"511","Jessica G.","Thanks all! Yes he was taken to the animal shelter so they went ahead and chipped him and all that good stuff. Bad news is I took him to the vet today and found out his pelvis is broken. They said there's nothing I can do for a broken pelvis other than pain management with pills and to keep him in a crate at all times for 6-8 weeks while it tries to heal. Vet said she ""doesn't want to get my hopes up that it will heal"". And I need to think seriously about if I want to give him a chance or if it would be best to put him down because he is in excruciating pain! I'm devastated!!!!!"
"511","Dana Loats","üò∞so sorry to hear"
"511","Gabby Rayvan","don't lose hope yet! the doctor said not to get your hopes up but that doesnt mean all hope is lost! give him a chance to heal first and observe how high his pain levels are. wishing the best of luck for this little guy!"
"511","Jessica G.","Thanks for the positivity. Yea he was showing discomfort but not severe pain like she said he's in. Dogs tend to hide when they're in pain because they don't want to show weakness :( poor guy!!! My heart hurts!"
"511","Maria Gomez","He's back and that's a blessing  :) .I will recommend researching  the  problem   on the internet for advise from other pet owners whose babies have a similar problem. Keep the faith God is good. Don't give up hope... maybe a type of brace? Second opinion?
Blessings,"
"511","Jimmy Moreno","The vet told us that are cat had no chance once and that he would lose his tail but after 8 weeks he was fine and he still has tail so stay positive"
"511","Jessica G.","Thanks that kiiiimnnda makes me feel a lil better. I'm just concerned about my ability to care for him properly. They said if it does heal it will take 6-8 weeks and I should keep him in a small crate at all times. So that he's unable to move that much and will be forced to rest"
"511","Jess Sean","I would get a second (and third) opinion. Take him to Village Vet in Los Feliz and see what they say. Vets can be really stupid sometimes. The vets at village vet are the most trusted I have found. I‚Äôm happy he is home. Don‚Äôt put him down!"
"511","mike antonelli","Please give gateway animal hospital and doctor Villacana a chance. They saved one of my dogs when all vets said there was no hope"
"511","Jessica G.","Thank you guys so much for the info! I will. And yes I thought it was a bit excessive to put him to sleep?!? He's only 3 years old - I hope that that kinda gives him an advantage to heal. Plus- he's already a lean, slender guy... but being on the streets for 2 weeks he lost sooooo much weight :( even his spine is showing not just his ribs. They weighed him in at barely 15lbs üò≠ but the fact that he isn't a super heavy or overweight dog helps not to put a strain on his bones"
"511","Jessica G.","Cowboy at the vet!"
"511","Jessica G.","My ESA! He's so stoic!!!!"
"511","Jess Sean","Poor baby!!!!"
"511","Pae White","He's young! He will heal quickly. I would imagine he would rather be in a small crate at home then wild on the street with the uncertainty. Definitely give him chance as I have had 2 animals come back from dire circumstances."
"511","Jessica G.","Hey guys so I made a GO FUND ME on behalf of Cowboy and his treatments... if you are able, please donate and Share my post on Facebook. My name on there is ""Jess Gonzo"" ....and even if you can't donate, please Share the post anyway :) I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you all for your support xoxoxoox"
"511","Angelica Garza","There‚Äôs got to be a better way to restrict his movement than to put him in a crate."
"511","Mitzi Spallas","I recently rescued a Dogo Argentino from the East Valley. When I went to the shelter, it broke my heart because he had been injured, maybe hit by a car. He could not use his back legs and had been pulling himself along the freeway with his front legs. My friend ended up adopting him. He kept him by his side every minute, and carried him outside to do his business and carried him back inside. He never let him run around or be active, and when he had to leave he created him. We were told the dog would never walk again. I wish I could post a video of him now. He is a little unsteady at times, but now he is a super happy dog, running and playing and enjoying life. We want to take him to a rehab place to see if he can get a little better through swimming and other low impact exercise. That is our plan for 2018. X-rays did cost a fortune as well as an MRI but totally worth it. Please do not take one vet‚Äôs word for it. I‚Äôve seen many dogs with broken pelvis who ended up ok. See 2 or 3 or 4 vets if you have to. If they all say the same thing, then maybe that is what it is. But do not give up without a fight. I will donate as well as share your Facebook page."
"511","Jessica G.","Thank you so much! That would be greatly appreciated if you are able to share and donate. That story lifted my spirits just a little about our circumstances though not much, I really miss him and just want to cuddle up to him in my cozy bed right now where he belongs üò≠it's extremely tough without him- he's my Emotional Support Animal and it's hard not having him to lean on right now about this if that makes any sense. First it was Xmas without him, and New Years... 2 weeks thinking I would never see him again- my heart was broken. Then he was found! And my heart full again with excitement and gratitude... now my heart hurts again because he's severely injured and I haven't heard any good news about it at all. :( Yes the X-rays were a killer!!! I reallly really really hope he comes back from this! I just can't believe he's in such bad shape. He's just so stoic! You'd never know he was hurt if it weren't for the obvious severely lopsided wonky hips üò≠I can't imagine that this could do him in for good üò∞üòìüò≠ I'll be taking his X-rays to another vet to get a second opinion Monday. This just cannot be IT for Cowboy, I just feel it in my heart that it's not the way to go. He's a survivor for sure! Survived 2 weeks scrounging on the streets and survived the car accident! If that's not fate I don't know what is. So, I NEED him to get through this and get better."

I thought he was hanging in the neighborhood outside of his house, he looked pretty confident. Pulled over but couldn‚Äôt lure him. I was right by Wax Paper cafe, maybe worth it to put some signs up over there?"
